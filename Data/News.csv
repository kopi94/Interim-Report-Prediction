Edgeware AB,2020-01-24 07:30:00,"“We are continuing our journey of change and demonstrated in the fourth quarterthat our existing customers are continuing to invest and that we are generatingmajor interest in our new projects.” Karl Thedéen, CEO, EdgewareFOURTH QUARTER 2019:  · Net sales totalled SEK 57.4 million (79.0), a decrease of 27.3 percent.  · Net sales totalled SEK 52.3 million (79.0), excluding newly acquired CavenaImage Products AB, a decrease of 33.8 percent.  · Gross profit amounted to SEK 39.5 million (56.6), corresponding to a grossmargin of 68.8 percent (71.7).  · Gross profit amounted to SEK 35.4 million (56.6), excluding newly acquiredCavena Image Products AB, corresponding to a gross margin of 67.5 percent(71.7).  · Operating income (EBIT) amounted to SEK 0.4 million (14.6), corresponding toan operating margin of 0.7 percent (18.4).  · Loss for the period amounted to SEK 6.1 million (profit: 10.6).  · Cash flow from operating activities was negative SEK 2.7 million (pos:20.7).  · Cash flow for the period was negative SEK 7.6 million (pos: 16.6).JANUARY-DECEMBER 2019:  · Net sales totalled SEK 184.4 million (231.9), a decrease of 20.5 percent.  · Net sales totalled SEK 168.8 million (231.9), excluding newly acquiredCavena Image Products AB, a decrease of  27.2 percent.  · Gross profit amounted to SEK 125.1 million (160.2), corresponding to a grossmargin of 67.8 percent (69.1).  · Gross profit amounted to SEK 111.7 million (160.2), excluding newly acquiredCavena Image Products AB, corresponding to a gross margin of 66.2 percent(69.1).  · Operating income (EBIT) amounted to negative SEK 25.2 million (neg: 9.1),corresponding to an operating margin of negative 13.7 percent (neg: 3.9).  · Loss for the period amounted to SEK 24.5 million (loss: 6.6).  · Cash flow from operating activities totalled SEK 3.1 million (11.6).  · Cash flow for the period was negative SEK 26.2 million (neg: 4.9). Thisincludes the cash-flow effect attributable to the acquisition of Cavena ImageProducts AB of negative SEK 9.1 million *.COMMENTS BY THE CEOSales for the fourth quarter were SEK 57 million, which is a decrease of 27percent compared with the year-earlier period. The primary cause of the declineis the decrease in CDN business in Western Europe, which we have mentionedbefore. Sales in Asia and Latin America increased during the quarter, on theother hand, though from relatively low levels. Our gross margin was 69 percent,which all in all resulted in a positive EBIT of SEK 0.4 million. Cash flow forthe quarter was a negative SEK 8 million, due primarily to the lower invoicevolume in preceding quarters, but our cash position remains strong at SEK 142million.Though we experienced a sharp decline in our CDN business in Western Europe, ourIPTV networks are still handling large volumes of traffic and the business isimportant to our customers. As proof of this, all our major CDN customers inWestern Europe renewed their support contracts during the year and all of themexcept one invested in CDN products from Edgeware during the quarter. We arealso in discussions with them regarding modernisation and new investments formanaging television services on several screen types. Our development andmarketing activities for Streampilot, our cloud-based service, have continuedand we have a number of established pilot tests with our customers. The positivefeedback we are receiving reinforces our conviction that we have a strongoffering that could result in orders for Streampilot in the first half of 2020.During the quarter, we also announced our sales and technological collaborationwith ENENSYS Technologies to better address cable operators, primarily those inLatin America.Sales for the full year came to SEK 184 million, compared to SEK 232 million forthe preceding year. The gross margin, however, was 68 percent – in line with thepreceding year. EBIT for the year amounted to a negative SEK 25 million,including SEK 5 million in restructuring expenses. Cash flow was a negative SEK26 million, of which SEK 9 million pertains to the acquisition of Cavena ImageProducts AB. Despite a negative performance and cash flow, our cash positionremains strong at SEK 142 million and we have no interest-bearing liabilities.The operating loss for the year can be explained by the changes taking place inthe Western European market as a result of the switch from IPTV to “Over thetop” (OTT) television (i.e. television streaming services that consumers canview from any device), and the fact that our customers are no longerexperiencing increases in IPTV subscribers. As a result, our major customers inEurope have cut back on their purchases of our CDN products for IPTV. With thisshift in the market as our starting point, we have embarked on a journey ofchange in which we are transforming the company from a hardware-centric businessto a more service and software-based one with an increasing share of recurringrevenue. Our strategy is threefold:  · Growing our recurring support and software revenue.  · Focusing on winning new CDN customers, primarily outside Western Europe.  · Launching new software products to strengthen our offering toward newcustomer groups such as broadcasters and content owners.That is why we acquired Cavena during the year and reoriented our productdevelopment toward new cloud and software-based services and products – forexample Streampilot, the cloud service for CDN control launched during the year.We also continued to enhance the efficiency of our operations, made changes toExecutive Management and created closer dialogue between our customers andproduct development. Through product development and a successful integration ofour acquired company, Cavena, we have strengthened and expanded our offering andwon new customers. It is therefore gratifying to see that our service businessgrew in 2019 by nearly 25 percent, to SEK 70 million.To better reflect the changes our operations are now undergoing, we have alsoadjusted our financial targets. We have a new target: increasing our recurringrevenue by 15 percent per year. The long-term profitability target is reduced to10 percent EBIT margin, but in the next two years we will need to continueinvesting in product and market development. This is why our short-termprofitability goal for the next two years is to improve our EBIT annually.In summary, while it has been a tough transitional year for us at Edgeware, wehave thoroughly analyzed the issues and have adjusted our strategy andinvestments accordingly. We have embarked on our journey of change, and with thesupport of a strong cash position and numerous interesting customer dialogues,we will continue to execute our plan. We look forward to the new decade.However, we are entering into 2020 with continued low sales volumes with ourlargest customers in Western Europe and we foresee top-line fluctuations betweenthe quarters as we build our new business.Karl ThedéenCEO, EdgewareContact:                             Annika Norin, CFO                                           Tel: +46708856774, E-mail:annika.norin@edgeware.tvThis information is inside information that Edgeware AB (publ) is obliged tomake public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

EBITA increased strongly by 29 percent in the quarter, which is betterthan the increase we profited from earlier in the year. All business areascontributed to the improvement. The EBITA margin increased to 9.7 percent. Bothacquisitions and higher sales contributed to the improved EBITA margin.Market developmentDemand for our products and solutions remained firm in most of our markets, andno clear indications of economic downturn in our business areas have beenidentified. Geographically, the highest growth rate was reached in Norway, whilethe business climate improved from an already high level in Finland. Also, inDenmark and Sweden, overall demand was positive, as was the business climateoutside the Nordic region. Our UK units are experiencing a degree of Brexit-related uncertainty.As a result of firm demand in our various customer segments, we increased salesof production components to manufacturers such as special vehicles, machinery,electronics, wind power and medical. Demand was stable in the telecom segment,and increased slightly in oil & gas.Developments in the marine segment remained highly positive. Demand foraftermarket products for the forest and process industry showed a favourabletrend, as did sales to the manufacturing industry. Sales of infrastructureproducts to power grid companies in the Nordic region increased, while demandfor niche products in electric power distribution and electricity-relatedproducts from construction and installation customers remained stable.AcquisitionsWe continuously evaluate acquisitions of independent, profitable technologycompanies with market-leading niche positions as well as bolt-on acquisitionsvia our existing companies, in order to strengthen market positions andprofitability in attractive segments. Since the beginning of the financial year,we have made fourteen acquisitions, two of which were completed after the end ofthe quarter. Of the businesses acquired, eleven were independent companies andthree bolt-on acquisitions, twelve based in the Nordic region, one in the UK andone in the Netherlands. The acquisitions together add annual sales of around SEK960 million and bring 276 employees to the Group.Many privately owned companies view Addtech as an attractive buyer, as they keeptheir decentralised responsibilities while simultaneously benefiting fromsupport for development via an active, long-term owner. Addtech’s acquisitionprocess is well integrated in the organisationand we have the financial capacity to maintain a normal pace ofacquisition going forward. We see high potential for further acquisitions bothin the Nordicregion and in northern Europe.Stockholm, 7 February 2019Niklas StenbergPresident and CEOThis information is information that Addtech AB (publ) is obliged to make publicpursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Securities Markets Act.

I am happy about the seven ElektaUnity orders in the quarter. However, margins were lower than expected mainlydue to project mix and price. We have ongoing measures to address these issuesand I see significant further improvement potential. The sales funnel for Unityis growing and feedback from customers who are treating patients is verypositive. Unity is clearly delivering on the promise to enable precisionradiation therapy in new clinical application fields.Since announcing our strategic focus on thought leadership in PrecisionRadiation Medicine in September, we have already made clear progress. Proofpoints during the quarter of how Elekta is driving access to innovative cancercare include: FDA 510(k) clearance for Elekta Unity and the first patientstreated in the U.S. at MD Anderson Cancer Center our first Unity order signedin the Middle East awards to Unity and MOSAIQ® for design and “best technology”respectively and the inauguration of our Elekta RT Academy in China.We also announced the launch of the global MOMENTUM program, which willscientifically guide the use of the MR-linac to improve cancer treatment. I’mlooking forward to seeing the clinical evidence for what I’m already hearingfrom customers - that Unity will have an impact on additional treatments andpotential better outcomes for patients.We saw strong order growth resulting in an increase of 12 percent for thequarter in constant currencies, and 9 percent year to date. This growth isunderlined by the feedback from our customers, oncologists, politicians andothers about the continued growing need for cost-effective cancer care, whereprecision radiation medicine plays an essential part.I’m pleased to see increasing interest in Unity – the seven systems added duringthe quarter is a clear reflection of this – and we see the sales funnelstrengthening. In addition to the order in the Middle East, we booked fourorders in the EU, one in China, and one in Australia. We are now at 39 orders,on track to reaching the target of 75 orders by mid-2020.Revenue came in at 14 percent for the quarter in constant currencies and 10percent year to date, driven by an increased number of installations across ourmarkets. On the back of this and what we foresee for the fourth quarter, we havedecided to raise our net sales growth outlook from around 7 percent, to around 8percent for the year.Gross margin declined due to an unfavorable projectmix and price in mature markets. This together with our ongoing ramp-up of thecommercialization of Unity and continued investment in China has led to an EBITAmargin of 15.2 percent in the quarter and 18.2 percent on a 12-month rollingbasis. I’m not satisfied with this margin level, and we have ongoing measures toimprove this, such as a COGS reduction program.

These factors were partially offset by higher staff andtechnology related costs as we continue to execute on our vision of being adigitally-enabled relationship bank. Higher PCL and a gain relating to thereorganization of Interac in the prior year also impacted earnings growth. Thecurrent year also included a write-down of deferred tax assets resulting from achange in the corporate tax rate in Barbados.Net income increased $33 million or 2% from last quarter, reflecting volumegrowth, seasonally lower marketing costs, and lower professional fees.

This measure does not have a standardizedmeaning under GAAP. For further information, refer to the Key Performance andnon-GAAP measures section on page 3 of this Earnings Release.  Wealth ManagementNet income remained unchanged from a year ago. Net interest income increased dueto higher interest rates and solid volume growth. Higher fee-based revenue wasdriven by an increase in average fee-based client assets as the diversificationof our leading product offerings and strong distribution network drove netsales, despite challenging market conditions. These factors were offset byhigher costs related to business growth, increases in PCL and regulatory costs,and lower transaction volumes as uncertainty impacted equity markets. Afavourable accounting adjustment related to Canadian Wealth Management in thecurrent period was largely offset by the impact of a favourable accountingadjustment related to City National in the prior period.Compared to last quarter, net income increased $44 million or 8%, primarilyreflecting an increase in net interest income, a favourable accountingadjustment related to Canadian Wealth Management in the current period, and thechange in fair value of seed capital investments. These factors were partiallyoffset by higher costs in support of business growth, and lower fee-basedrevenue resulting from challenging market conditions throughout the earlier partof the first quarter.  InsuranceNet income increased $39 million or 31% from a year ago, primarily reflectingfavourable life retrocession contract renegotiations and lower claims costs.Compared to last quarter, net income decreased $152 million or 48%, as the priorperiod included annual actuarial assumption updates, higher favourableinvestment-related experience, and higher favourable life retrocession contractrenegotiations.  Investor & Treasury ServicesNet income decreased $58 million or 26%, primarily due to lower funding andliquidity revenue, higher costs in support of business growth, and lower revenuefrom our asset services business due to challenging market conditions and lowerclient activity. These factors were partially offset by improved client depositmargins.Compared to last quarter, net income increased $6 million or 4%, primarily dueto higher funding and liquidity revenue, lower technology costs, and improvedclient deposit margins. These factors were partially offset by annual regulatorycosts in the current period.  Capital MarketsNet income decreased $95 million or 13%, primarily due to higher PCL and lowerrevenue in Corporate and Investment Banking due to challenging market conditionsand lower issuance activity. These factors were partially offset by a lowereffective tax rate reflecting changes in earnings mix and the impact of foreignexchange translation.Compared to last quarter, net income decreased $13 million or 2%, primarily dueto lower revenue in Corporate and Investment Banking and higher PCL. Thesefactors were partially offset by higher revenue in Global Markets and a lowereffective tax rate reflecting changes in earnings mix.  Corporate SupportNet income was $24 million in the current quarter, largely reflecting netfavourable tax adjustments. Net income was $20 million in the prior quarter,also largely reflecting net favourable tax adjustments. Net loss was$200 million in the prior year, primarily due to the impact of the U.S. TaxReform of $178 million, which was primarily related to the write-down of netdeferred tax assets.  Other HighlightsCapital - As at January 31, 2019, Basel III CET1 ratio was 11.4%, down 10 bpsfrom last quarter as strong internal capital generation was partially offset byhigher risk-weighted assets due to business growth and the impact fromregulatory changes. We also continued to return a significant portion of ourcapital to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks.Credit Quality - Total PCL of $514 million increased $180 million or 54% fromthe prior year, mainly due to a higher provision on impaired loans in CapitalMarkets taken on one account in the utilities sector. Higher provisions onperforming loans, mainly in Capital Markets and Wealth Management, driven byunfavourable changes in certain near-term macroeconomic variables, alsocontributed to the increase.Total PCL on loans of $516 million increased $183 million, or 55% from the priorquarter related to higher provisions in Capital Markets and Personal &Commercial Banking. PCL on performing loans of $93 million, compared to$44 million in the prior quarter, was driven by unfavourable changes in certainnear-term macroeconomic variables, largely impacting Capital Markets and WealthManagement.PCL on impaired loans of $423 million was up $134 million from the priorquarter, mainly due to a provision taken in the utilities sector in CapitalMarkets and higher provisions on the Caribbean Banking and Canadian BusinessBanking portfolios. PCL ratio on impaired loans of 28 bps was up 8 bps from lastquarter.

Auction Turnover amounted to DKK 738.2m (858.9), corresponding to a decrease of 14.1 percent. In addition to the reduction in core business, 6.3 percent is due to lower Auction Turnover in Fine Art business in Sweden, which was sold in Q1 and 2.1 percent is due to the depreciation of the Swedish krone.Average knockdown price for the online business increased by 2.7 percent to DKK 2,473 (2,408), and number of knockdowns was 270,472 (302,635) for the online business.· Revenue amounted to DKK 117.6m (195.7). The reduction is primarily due to lower fees from sale of partnership agreements   DKK 0m (28.4m) as well as the divested businesses DKK -31.6m. The remaining reduction is due to lower Auction Turnover impacting Revenue by DKK -13.6m (primarily In Q1 to Q3) and impact of depreciation of the Swedish krone DKK -3.6mCost level in like for like business is reduced by 7-8 percent compared to last year. The remaining part of the change in cost is due to lower cost following the sale of auction houses, change in accounting for leases and depreciation of the Swedish krone.Gain from sale of Stockholms Auktionsverk's Fine Art business DKK 8.4m is included in other income.· Auction Turnover Margin1 amounted to -1.2 (5.2) percent. 2018 is impacted by impairments.Profit amounted to DKK -69.5m (-11.3) and earnings per share amounted to DKK -130.98 (-21.24).The property at Rovsingsgade 68 was sold. The transaction had no impact on the result of 2018.Commercial development 2018After many years of growth, Lauritz.com experienced a significant drop in Auction Turnover in 2017 due to a more aggressive competition from an increasing number of both traditional and new players within sales of vintage items. In 2018, the core Auction Turnover has shown signs of stabilization with a decrease of 5.5 percent in local currency compared to last year.Sales- and marketing initiatives have been intensified during 2018, and the increased focus on operations of the business has shown improvements in Q4 (-5.1 percent) compared to Q3 (-7.7 percent).The positive development in continuing into 2019. Based on the development seen during January and February 2019, we foresee that Q1 2019 has positive outlooks compared to last year.Refinancing of BondsLauritz.com has now reached an agreement with the bondholders to refinance the bonds due to be redeemed in June 2019.The changes are significant, and result in a write down of the outstanding debt by SEK 118m (DKK 85m) to SEK 200m (DKK 145m), a reduction of the interest rate from 7.5 percent on the full amount to 4 percent on SEK 130m, and 7.5 percent on SEK 70m, extention of the final redemption date to 2024 and removal of the financial covenants.To achieve these improvements additional security has been provided to the bondholders. The main shareholder has agreed to provide additional security through a pledge in the vineyard Chateau Vignelaure.Furthermore Lauritz.com is obliged to pursue a divestment of certain auction houses, combined with establishing a partnership agreement for these.Chairman Bengt Sundström, explains:We are very happy that the new terms have now been approved by our bondholders. I strongly believe in the future of Lauritz.com. Lauritz.com are about to launch a number of important commercial initiatives to re-establish the convincing growth path that has been our track history from 1999 until 2017. Since 2017, we have been finding our new ways around a more competitive, but also growing, market of vintage items. In 2018, we have been stabilizing the development of our core business and we are positive about the outlooks for 2019.As to the coming years, we expect a strong development in the markets for vintage and used items and will apply a progressive and very visible market approach as well as work on developing our pipeline of auction houses interested in partnering up with Lauritz.com into new branches. Furthermore, we are working intensely on a new state-of-the-art auction platform which will in several areas redefine and expand the perception of the international auction market.Impairments and changes to accounting estimatesIn connection with the preparation of every  quarterly statement we assess if there is a need to write down the value of assets in the balance sheet in order to give a true and fair view of the value of these.In connection with the Q4 reporting the following adjustments to accounting estimates and Impairments has been made:Reassessed the expected value of the Fine Art transaction, resulting in a change in the gain from the sale of the Fine Art business from DKK 40.4m to DKK 8.4mImpairment of Goodwill and receivables from sale partnership agreements of DKK 31.5m.A reservation of DKK 19.5m is made on receivables form sale of partnership agreements to be prepared for future losses.The value adjustments included in the Q4 report are a consequence of recent performance and more prudent expectations. Especially the performance in the Fine Art Business of Stockholms Aktionsverk has been disappointing after the sales of 51% of this specific business in Q1, leading to a substantially smaller earn-out amount than expected. As to the goodwill and receivables from sales of partnership agreement, the performance in the partner houses have been lower than expected which have influenced the time frame in which the partners will redeem their loans from Lauritz.com.These impairments impact the result of 2018. The write down of the bond debt will materialize in 2019, and will impact the result and equity positively by approximately DKK 80 - 85m during the first half of 2019, bringing Equity to a level around DKK 62m. The result for 2018 is significantly impacted by the impairments mentioned above. EBITDA for the year is DKK -8.9m and EBT is DKK -72.0m.Excluding the impairments and gain from sale of the Fine Art business (and partnership agreements) the EBITDA is DKK 4.4m (13.1).The change in the result from the auction operations is a result of lower revenue, partly offset by cost reductions, divested operations and the change in accounting for leases.Cost level in like for like business reduced by 7-8 percent comparing with last year, showing the way to a new leaner organization with ability to deliver strong earnings.The guidance for the result of 2018 was updated in connection with the announcement of the written procedure for the changes to the bonds on 6 February 2019. Compared to the guidance given in connection with the Q3 report, the result is impacted negatively by the imparments and changes in accounting estimated made in the Q4 report as mentioned in the update on 6 February.Strategic initiativesOur strategic review aimed at developing a long-term strategy that secures long-term growth and profitability is ongoing. We are closely reviewing e.g. how to develop our business model, value proposition and product experience on the digitized market for auctions.The separation of Stockholms Auktionsverk's Fine Art business in Q1 into a new individual company (whereof Lauritz.com Group owns 49%) is aimed at creating an ultimate focus by all our online auction houses in Sweden towards driving the online business in the middle segment market.Our dedicated employees and partners in combination with high user engagement among our customers, and a well functioning marketplace for online auctions, are true strengths for our business. Significant volumes of items are being sold at Lauritz.com every day and we have a strong position in the online auction industry.The ambitious commercial initiatives being taken to return Lauritz.com to the growth path followed for many years, except for the last two, are now beginning to show results. This is encuraging, and we are strengthening our efforts further to motivate and drive sales as well as increasing the number of individual sellers. Below follows some examples of initiatives.Lauritz.com's brand values are all about a democratic approach to auctions, making auctions accessible and convenient for modern consumers - in a contemporary and trendsetting way. After having launched our successful app and mobile website in recent years, we are now developing a new state-of-the-art, fashionable responsive (desktop) website.  Furthermore, in order to keep a high visibility in the market, we continuously and persistently communicate our standard free pickup-service and personal booking of experts for private home visits towards sellers in advertising campaigns in larger national printed media. The new campaign launched in Q4 2018 is being expanded and will continue in 2019. For digital media we are rolling out a significant increase in digital campaigns.Parallelly, we have launched an initiative to encourage our professional sellers to consign larger lot stocks, like previous season's product inventories or surplus items that are suitable for selling at auctions. The benefits of selling at auction are many for our professional sellers -some of the major benefits are massive exposure and a higher stock turnover rate as well as storage room, logistics and resales all being handled by the auction house.Also, to give both private and professional sellers more comfort in relation to the price they will achieve in an auction, we are working at a more flexible and individual setup for setting minimum prices and the starting bid for the auction.The financial analysis has been completed in terms of refinancing the bonds, but we will continue efforts to secure additional equity to strengthen the financial position of the Group, and further strengthen our capital structure.The results achieved in 2018 and in the first two month of 2019, in securing the financing situation, as well as the signs of a return to growth in Auction Turnover confirm our belief in a successful development in the coming years for Lauritz.com.

Lauritz.com has 26 physical auction houses in 6 countries. Here local sellers can consign items for auction. Sellers can also interact with the local house by getting an online evaluation, by booking an expert for a home visit or by booking Lauritz.com's pick-up service to transport items from the seller to the auction house. All items are estimated, described and photographed objectively by Lauritz.com's experts. Each lot is put up for an individual timed auction for 5 days, sold to the highest bid and shipped to the buyer. All items are presented on physical viewing in the given local auction house during the auction period. Major collections or more expensive items are high-lighted on special theme actions.Lauritz.com offers an authenticity guaranty to avoid falsification and copies.AssortmentLauritz.com sold over 300.000 lots on auction in 2017. The wide assortment comprises everything from luxury flee market finds to costly international art works - from DKK 800 and up. The categories cover e.g. modern and antique art and sculptures, furniture, lamps, carpets, ceramics, silver, glass, jewellery, clocks, wine, hunting equipment, collectables.

High volumes are sold daily of the most famous furniture by Scandinavian architects as Arne Jacobsen, Wegner, Finn Juhl, Poul Kjærholm etc. The modern furniture categories add up to approx. 40 percent of Lauritz.com's auction turnover.CustomersLauritz.com's customer profile stretches from trendsetters to pensioners, students to top executives. Lauritz.com strives to create a universe that appeals to everyone, whatever their taste, budget or age.

Lauritz.com has over 3 million customer registrations and up to 5 million visits monthly. Customers come from approx. 200 countries.Market positionLauritz.com focuses on the middle market segment for lots with a value between DKK 800 and 50.000. This segment positions Lauritz.com between classified platforms with high volume at low prices and the fine art market with low volume and high prices. Lauritz.com can be described as an innovative combination of EBay and Sotheby's.Business modelLauritz.com has a simple business model, based on a healthy premium structure. All auction items are sold in commission (which means that Lauritz.com has no inventory). When an item is sold, the buyer pays 22.5 percent in buyer's premium plus a knockdown fee of DKK 150. The seller pays 15 percent in seller's premium plus a knockdown fee of DKK 150. The buyer pays the knockdown and premiums within 3 days. Lauritz.com pays the seller within 35 days.Geographical expansionThe main challenge in the auction business is to create a sufficient in-flow of items from local private and professional sellers to present to global buyers. Lauritz.com has a strong track record establishing physical auction houses for this vital local sourcing of items. Lauritz.com can open local auction houses in 3 ways by opening own operations greenfield, by finding local partners to start in a franchise-like model or by acquiring regional auction houses to convert their traditional physical auctions to online auctions. Germany is considered the next growth market with a potential of up to 20 Lauritz.com houses (at present 3). Furthermore, UK is an attractive market to open on long term for local consignments in the up to 10 major cities.Scalable platformsLauritz.com's platforms - and head-quarter set-up - is highly scalable as to increasing the number of items on auction, increasing online traffic, establishing new auction houses and opening new countries. Lauritz.com already exist in 6 languages, and more can be added.Business opportunitiesMany opportunities are still to be explored and possibly launched. E.g. management sees a considerate potential in introducing a 'Buy now' feature, increasing the number of new-produced items on auction (from design producers/retailers), shortening payment time to sellers, a new payment service, optimizing even quicker/cheaper shipment to buying customers, introducing adds on the platforms and offering new products like consumer loans.OwnersLauritz.com A/S is wholly owned by Lauritz.com Group A/S. Lauritz.com Group A/S is since 22 June 2016 listed on Nasdaq First Premier Stockholm with the ticker LAUR.

Therefore, the commercial launch of JUNO began on 1[st] of November wherenew users and customers are getting access only to the new platform.  · The Nomination Committee for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (AGM)has been appointed.CEO flemming breinholt comments on the quarter:During the third quarter, Karnov’s operations continued to deliver good resultsand the roll-out of our new joint platform in Sweden went as planned.Net sales grew organically by 6 percent. The growth was generated by a continuedstrong sales performance by our online business. In addition, the growth in thethird quarter was also influenced by a growth in the offline sales. Offlinesales are normally good in the third quarter, due to the start of the academicyear in the universities. This year offline sales in the quarter also includedsales postponed from the second quarter, but year to date, offline sale hasdeclined by 2.6 percent in line with the overall trends and expectations.      Adjusted EBITA margin declined slightly by 0.6 percentage points to 38.9percent. This was also an effect of the strong sales of textbooks and otheroffline products, where our margins are lower than on online services. Lookinginstead at the year-to-date period, which is more relevant, adjusted EBITAmargin improved by 1.1 percentage points to 38.6 percent.      The third quarter has always produced the weakest cash generation giventiming of subscription invoicing. This year was no exception in that pattern,but we managed to improve cash flow from last year’s third quarter and generateda SEK 2 million positive adjusted operating cash flow.Continued roll-out of new joint platform in SwedenThe roll-out in Sweden of JUNO has continued during the quarter, and per today98 percent of all users have been onboarded to this new online platform.

This means thatMedivir now has four ongoing clinical trials in cancer, two in phase I and twoin phase II. In our clinical portfolio, there are also two projects that havebeen through phase II remetinostat for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and MIV-711for osteoarthritis. We are now looking forward to starting the phase Ib part ofthe study with MIV-818 in liver cancer, and to carry out the futility analysisof the phase II study with birinapant and Keytruda®, in the fourth quarter. Inaddition to having succeeded in further developing our clinical portfolio withinoncology, we can also note that in the third quarter we achieved the goal wepreviously communicated, namely that the fixed costs of the business are now atone third of last year's level, and that with an efficient, competent andexperienced organization.Let me summarize the status of our clinical portfolio during the quarter.MIV-818 is Medivir's proprietary nucleotide prodrug, designed to provide atargeted anti-tumor effect in the liver while minimizing any adverse sideeffects.In an ongoing phase I study, the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics ofMIV-818 are studied in patients with advanced liver cancer.In June, we presented an analysis of data from the first six patients in thephase Ia portion of the study indicating that MIV-818 has the intended liver-directed effect. MIV-818 was well tolerated and in addition, an effect signalon liver biopsies from tumor tissue was observed in MIV-818 treated patients.Unlike the tumor, normal liver tissue does not appear to have been affected bythe treatment.The early clinical results in the phase Ia part constitute a proof-of-conceptfor this in-house developed project. There is a very large potential here tomake a vital difference for patients lacking good treatment options. We are nowlooking forward to starting the phase Ib part of the MIV-818 study in the fourthquarter.After the end of the quarter, preclinical data for MIV-818 were presented at theAACR-NCI-EORTC conference in Boston. The data show that MIV-818 has animmunomodulatory effect in vitro and increases the ability of white blood cellsto kill cancer cells, especially when combined with the anti-PD1 checkpointinhibitor pembrolizumab. These data open up the possibility of futurecombinations of MIV-818 with immunotherapy.Our preclinical candidate drug MIV-828 for the treatment of blood cancer is,like MIV-818, a completely proprietary nucleotide-based prodrug. This is yet anexample of Medivir's ability to develop its own high-quality candidate drugs. Aswith all clinical development, cost is decisive for the pace at which projectscan be developed. Right now, we are focusing on MIV-818, but we hope to startthe preclinical development of the promising MIV-828 soon.Remetinostat is our topical HDAC inhibitor that is developed to treat mycosisfungoides, the most common form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, an unusual form ofblood cancer that occurs first in the skin. Medivir has determined the design ofa phase III study based on the clarifications we received from the FDA at theend of last year. We are looking for a partner for the continued development andcommercialization of remetinostat.In an ongoing investigator-initiated study in collaboration with researchers atStanford University, remetinostat is given to patients with basal cell cancer(BCC). The preliminary results indicate that remetinostat has potential as aneffective and well-tolerated treatment of local skin tumors in BCC patients.Birinapant is Medivir's SMAC mimetic that is being developed in combination withMerck's anti-PD-1 treatment Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) as a treatment forpatients with colorectal cancer. The efficacy of the combination therapy isevaluated in an ongoing phase II study with patients with microsatellite stable(MSS) colorectal cancer, a cancer form in which treatment with Keytruda® alonevery rarely gives effect. The study evaluates preliminary efficacy as well assafety and tolerability. A futility analysis of the study will be presented inQ4 2019.In addition, a phase I study was initiated in October by the National CancerInstitute in the United States where patients with head or neck cancer aretreated with Medivir's birinapant in combination with radiation therapy. Theprimary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of the combinationtherapy and to determine a maximum tolerated dose for further studies. Potentialsigns of treatment efficacy will also be studied.We look forward to the results of this study and hope that they will providesupport for birinapant's potential to be included in several types ofcombination treatments of a number of different cancers.For MIV-711, Medivir's cathepsin K inhibitor for the treatment ofosteoarthritis, we have now compiled a comprehensive data package with the datafrom the extension study presented in the previous quarter. Medivir continues toaim to establish a licensing or collaboration agreement for MIV-711.In addition to the clinical development of our portfolio, we work intensively onbusiness development for our projects. We work with a strong commitment andcompassion to develop Medivir's candidate drugs in the right direction andimprove therapies for patients with large unmet medical needs. By doing this, wehope to create great values for our shareholders as well as for society atlarge.Uli HacksellPresident & CEOFor further information, please contactUli Hacksell, CEO, +46 (0) 8 5468 3100Magnus Christensen, CFO, +46 (0)73-125 0620This report has been subject to auditors’ review.The information in this report comprises the information that Medivir is obligedto disclose under the provisions of the Swedish Securities Markets Act.The information was submitted for publication at 11.00 CET on 27 November 2019."

The recruitment process to find a new CFO hascommencedCEO’s commentA good START TO THE YEARWe began the new school year by opening our new school in Skellefteå andwelcoming a total of 26,800 students to our 37 schools in Sweden and 2,500students to our five schools in Spain as they embarked on a new academic year.The year started well and proceeded according to plan, with operating incomeincreasing 8.1% year-on-year, while EBIT declined to MSEK 11.8 (23.5), excludingthe effects of IFRS 16 and the capital gain generated by the divestment of thejointly owned school Colegio IALE. This decrease in earnings was entirelyattributable to the fact that the seasonally weak first quarter in Spain has agreater negative impact as the number of schools we have in the countryincreases. However, on a full-year basis, Spain is expected to continue todeliver strong earnings.Continued growthAugust is always a special month in the school world. It marks a new start andwarm welcome to all schoolchildren. Full of anticipation, they start the newschool year with a sense of curiosity and excitement to see if they will haveany new classmates or teachers.This year, we started a brand new school in Skellefteå. It is always anincredible feeling to open a new school as it means so much to the localcommunity: to the municipality, the business community and the residentsthemselves. This is particularly true in Skellefteå, which is now becoming agrowth municipality and focusing on education as an important cornerstone of anattractive residential area and business location.In autumn 2018, we opened IES Sundbyberg on a small scale, with only six classesas we waited for the building to be fully renovated. In August of this year, wewere finally ready to open the entire school and welcome ten more classes, whichessentially means that we opened an entire new school. Parents in bothSkellefteå and Sundbyberg have shown considerable interest and the schools aredeveloping according to plan.We also continued to attract major interest from parents and municipalities inother locations across Sweden and have so far announced our plans to open eightnew schools in the next three years. This is the first time we have had suchgood visibility in terms of the number of new schools. Along with our queue,this provides us with a stable foundation when it comes to planning the futureof our operations.We are also evaluating several acquisition candidates in Spain and at thebeginning of the quarter, we completed the simplification of ownership thatbegan in 2018, when we sold the last jointly owned school to our co-owners. Thisdivestment generated a capital gain of MSEK 24.7, which was recognised duringthe quarter. We now have five schools in Spain, which are all IES subsidiaries.Seasonal effects putting pressure on earningsThe year got off to a good start and as expected. The Swedish operations have abetter balance this year between the increase in voucher funding and theincrease in teacher salaries than in the past couple of years. During thequarter, revenues per student in Sweden increased 3.4%, personnel expenses perstudent increased 2.7% and total costs per student increased 3.1% compared withthe year-earlier quarter.In Spain, the first quarter is always seasonally weak since the school year doesnot start until early September. Since we have more schools in Spain than in thepreceding year, this negative seasonal effect was amplified. The full-year planfor the Spanish operations for 2019/2020, without any additional acquisitionsand excluding the capital gain, is to generate operating income of approximatelyMEUR 21.6 (about MSEK 230), EBITDA of approximately MEUR 3.9 (about MSEK 41) andEBIT of approximately MEUR 2.2 (MSEK 23). The outcome for the first quarter wasin line with this plan.For the Group as a whole, operating income increased 8.1% to MSEK 600.7 duringthe quarter, of which organic growth amounted to 7.0%. The EBIT margin amountedto 9.1% (4.2) and excluding IFRS 16 and the capital gain from the sale of theSpanish school, the EBIT margin was 2.0% (4.2).Major impact on financial statements due to the introduction of IFRS 16In Sweden, we rent 37 schools from municipalities and property companies. We area long-term operator and therefore undertake long-term commitments for ourschool properties. Our rental contracts can extend for up to 25 years. We dareto make these commitments since our school operations are stable, with ourqueues and the demographic trend of a growing number of school-age childrenproviding us with predictable revenues and thus an opportunity to accuratelyplan our operations. However, the introduction of IFRS 16 entails that our leaseexpenses are to be recognised as a right-of-use asset and lease liability in thebalance sheet, which means that our total assets have increased SEK 3.4 billion,while part of our lease expenses have been moved from EBIT to net financialitems, which resulted in higher EBIT. Although this did not result in anychanges in terms of how we conduct our operations, it had a significant impacton our financial statements and thus on our key figures. In the tables and notesin this report, we have attempted to make it as clear and simple as possible tointerpret our figures both excluding and including this accounting effect.Strategically important permission for an international schoolIn October, the Swedish Schools Inspectorate announced that we had been givenpermission to start an international school in Skellefteå that follows theCambridge Assessment curriculum. Our aim is to supplement the F-9 compulsoryschool that we opened in August 2019 to allow us to offer students whopreviously studied abroad an opportunity to continue studying theirinternational curriculum. The international school is scheduled to open inautumn 2020 alongside IES’s existing operations in the same school building. Weare pleased to be able to contribute to the development of Skellefteå and makeit easier for companies in the municipality to attract international employeesby offering an internationally recognised education in the area.There are many municipalities and companies that need to attract aninternational workforce in Sweden, and we will now be able to evaluate thepossibility, in close dialogue with these municipalities and companies, for moreof our schools to offer education according to an international curriculum.An orderly school environment crucial to good resultsProgress has been slow when it comes to initiatives to improve the quality ofSwedish schools, and 16% of all students who complete compulsory school inSweden are not qualified to begin upper secondary school. There are, however,certain bright spots and there are school leaders across Sweden who are takingon these problems and deciding to take a different approach to achieve results.I am therefore delighted when I read in the newspaper about schools that havesucceeded in reversing this trend and improving their rate of qualification forupper secondary school. Clear feedback to the students and an orderly schoolenvironment are also common denominators for many of these schools. Theimportance of having a clear structure and an orderly school environment cannotbe overstated, particularly for those students who have not learnt good studyhabits at home.However, a number of investigations and reviews are being carried out in thefield of education to deal with the issue of quality. One such initiative is arevision of the national curriculum, which needs to be carried out at regularintervals – although not too often since this shifts the focus from studentlearning to teachers learning the new curriculum. The new proposal from theSwedish National Agency for Education to revise the curriculum is a small stepin the right direction, with greater focus placed on factual knowledge andunderstanding and less focus on abilities. This is something we are pleased withand for which we have advocated for a long time. But, there is also a need forclearer grading criteria, which the new national curriculum will make possible,and more national tests – more frequent tests in more subjects which should begraded centrally in order to increase transparency, predictability andconfidence in Swedish students’ knowledge.This is my last report before I hand over the reins to Anna Sörelius Nordenborgnext week. I would like to thank the students, parents, employees,municipalities, the Board of Directors and our shareholders for being part ofdevelopment of this outstanding company.Cecilia MarlowInterim CEOFOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:Emma Rheborg, Head of Communications, tel. +46 (0)768-511 540Cecilia Marlow, Interim CEO, tel. +46 (0)73-414 61 28Fredrik Åkerman, CFO, tel. +46 (0)70-415 23 65TELECONFERENCE IN CONNECTION WITH PUBLICATION OF THE QUARTERLY REPORT:Interim CEO Cecilia Marlow and CFO Fredrik Åkerman will be holding ateleconference today, Thursday 21 November, at 10:00 a.m. in connection withpublication of the quarterly report.

Operating activities recorded year-on-year turnover increases of 6%for the quarter and 13% for the first nine months.We posted robust underlying earnings with healthy and stable margins. However,our total margin was impacted by poor profitability at RA Bygg. The changeprogram aimed at strengthening the property maintenance and constructionservices concept as well as improving profitability at RA Bygg has already beeninitiated and will continue through the autumn.Our increased focus on cash flow and on reducing tied-up working capital hasdelivered results. Over the first nine months of the year, cash flow held astable and healthy level. I am confident in the work we have invested. Thetemporary third-quarter decline was attributable to the high level of capitaltied up in accounts receivable, since a major part of the invoicing for thequarter was conducted in September.Demand remains positive in the locations where we operate the majority of ourprojects are in central Stockholm. Most of our ongoing projects comprise theremodelling of commercial properties. There is considerable need to change andadapt existing premises to achieve greater flexibility and efficiency.

In September, our contract with Brabo and Fabegewas expanded to include the internal completion of the 420-plus apartments weare constructing at Haga Norra in Solna. We established operations at the sitein spring 2018 with the initial project planning for Bilia’s facility, and wehave driven the work forward through several stages. The continuation of thecontract, with the completion of the homes we have started, is highly gratifyingand confirms that our project focus and collaborative approach to our customersand other stakeholders lead to results.Two further major contracts were signed at the start of the fourth quarter.Zengun has been entrusted by CA Fastigheter to construct the new Strato landmarkbuilding.

Positive cash flow will be prioritized to create stabilityand reduce the company’s net debt. In practice, this means prioritizing rentalprojects with forward funding. The changes are the result of a comprehensivereview that was carried out in Q3 2019.The review confirms the company’s strong core in the form of its target group,housing concept, home market and micro-locations of building rights, but it alsoresulted in the revaluation of certain balance sheet items for a number ofproject properties and joint venture assets, leading to write-downs during thequarter. The revaluations, however, do not affect the company’s cash flow. TheWest Side Solna and Metronomen cooperative apartment projects and the Täby Turfrental project are the projects that will contribute positive cash flow in theshort term since they will be completed between Q3 2019 and Q4 2021.The company is currently evaluating several alternatives to achieve long-termstable financing including increasing SSM’s equity and refinancing the company’sloans. The company is of the view that that it should be possible to have arefinancing solution in place in time to repay the loans that are due in 2020.Given the stabilized housing market, the solid market for rental projects andthe company’s optimized business model with more balanced financial risk-taking,I see a positive future for SSM.

Baltic Horizon Fund / Northern Horizon Capital,2019-11-15 17:00:00,"Baltic Horizon Fund / Northern Horizon CapitalInterim report (Q1 and Q3)Baltic Horizon Fund Consolidated Un-Audited Results for Q3 2019Gross Asset Value (GAV)In Q3 2019, the GAV increased slightly from EUR 344.9 million to EUR 345.3 million compared to the end of Q2 2019. The increase is mainly related to the increase in investment property book value due to capital expenditures and the increase in cash as a result of the newly acquired Galerija Centrs’s positive effect on the Fund’s cash flows over the quarter.Net Asset Value (NAV)In Q3 2019, the Fund NAV increased from EUR 131.1 million to EUR 135.2 million compared to the end of Q2 2019. The Fund NAV was positively affected by the Fund’s operational performance over the quarter and capital raising in the amount of EUR 4 million (net equity) through a private placement in July. However, this was offset by a EUR 2.6 million cash distribution to unitholders (EUR 0.026 per unit) and a negative cash flow hedge reserve movement during the quarter.Net Rental Income and Net ProfitIn Q3 2019, the Fund earned a net profit of EUR 3.1 million (EUR 2.2 million during Q3 2018). In Q3 2019, the Fund recorded a EUR 5.4 million net rental income (EUR 3.8 million in Q3 2018).

The information was submitted for publication at 8:05a.m. CET on November 15, 2019.Non-IFRS Measures:This press release includes non-IFRS measures not defined under IFRS,specifically EBITDA and Adjusted operating cash flow. Non-IFRS measures have nostandardized meaning prescribed under IFRS and therefore such measures may notbe comparable with those used by other companies.  EBITDA is a useful metric toquantify the Company’s ability to generate cash before extraordinary and non-cash accounting transactions recognized in the financial statements. Inaddition, EBITDA is useful to analyze and compare profitability betweencompanies and industries because it eliminates the effects of financing andaccounting policy decisions. The most comparable IFRS measure to EBITDA is netincome (loss). In addition, adjusted operating cash flow is used by investors tocompare cash flows from operating activities without the effects of certainvolatile items that can positively or negatively affect changes in workingcapital and are viewed as not directly related to a company’s operatingperformance. The most comparable IFRS measure to adjusted operating cash flow iscash flow used in operations. Refer to Etrion’s MD&A for the three and ninemonths ended September 30, 2019, for a reconciliation of EBITDA and adjustedoperating cash flow reported during the period.Forward-Looking Information:This press release contains certain “forward-looking information”.

Our organic growth has also seen a positive developmentduring Q3. Our focus on Express Ad Hoc has resulted in a favourable mix that ismaking good progress towards higher margins, which is also supported by anenhanced commercial focus on high-margin air freight products in our systemizedsegment. During Q3 we have introduced new campaigns that focus on long tailcustomers, where the focus areas have been our geographic coverage andflexibility.The campaigns and a commercial focus on vertical solution selling have fuelled asatisfactory revenue growth of 6.4% (5.4%), and the underlying organic growth is5.7%, which is a significant improvement from Q2. Total segment growth inExpress Ad Hoc equals 9.2% and in Express Systemized 2.4%, which is due tocommercial initiatives combined with strong growth in Belgium.Our long-term growth target (5%) remains unchanged, as we have a strong salespipeline including potential new orders as well as already signed but not yetactivated agreements.Efforts to improve contribution margins have been successful, as our marginincreased to 34.2% (32.0%) in Q3, which is mainly due to a stronger margin andvolume growth in the Express Ad Hoc segment.Our commercial initiatives will continue according to plan, and we maintain ourfocus on sales efficiency, solution selling and new partnerships, as well as onexploring new systemized solutions and network enhancement. Jetpak iscontinuously challenging supplier models to provide further cost efficiency, andour Q95 quality project is ensuring a strong quality improvement.New potential acquisition targets are being explored in Europe and the Nordiccountries, and we have intensified our efforts to acquire a company in the localcourier and distribution segment, which will ensure a stronger market positionand potential pan-Nordic growth. Currently a letter of intent has been signedwith one selected target.Despite some uncertainty and concerns related to macroeconomic indicators insome of our main markets, we have achieved satisfactory growth in terms ofrevenue and EBITA. Norway has continued its strong growth and Sweden hasstabilized at an acceptable level.Our main Scandinavian competitors among postal operators continue to focus oncost efficiency and scale benefits in volume driven parcel flows, which benefitsJetpak and our continued growth potential.Despite increased price competition Jetpak is managing to maintain its marketshare by providing greater flexibility and high quality, which is reducing therisk of margin deterioration and decreasing revenues.We are cautiously monitoring market developments and are well prepared to meetfuture market changes thanks to our agile organization and asset light businessmodel.

We cannow see the finish line and we hope that the next couple of months develop asplanned so that we can achieve our ambitious goal.   Due to our interactionswith the FDA during the year, we have been able to achieve acceptance by the FDAof a revised design of the confirmatory part of our study, using a moresensitive endpoint, which reduces the number of patients and shortens theconfirmatory part of the trial substantially.

Norway continued on a path ofmixed development, with a strong increase in sales of Electric Vehicles whilethe sales of petrol and diesel fueled vehicles continued to decrease. Strongercompetition from an increase in the offer of Electric Vehicles lead to adecrease in our market share. In Belgium, the market also continued to decrease,while our business grew in both relative and absolute numbers from the strengthof the Mercedes-Benz brand, which has established itself as the leading premiumbrand in Belgium. In conclusion, this year is still very much a wait for thelaunch of a wider range of Electric Vehicles and Plugin Hybrid Electric Vehiclesthat will start in 2020.Sales of used cars continues to improve in all markets, with higher margins andincreased inventory turnover.Aftermarket services has improved margins and we are working to build long termcustomer relationships through the offer of service agreements and targetedseasonal offers.During this quarter, we have expanded our market for BMW in Norway and Mercedes-Benz in Belgium through strategic acquisitions. Three years after our initialreview of the Belgian market, we have now completed the acquisitions that weinitially planned. This serves to prove our strategy of building strong marketpresence and a competitive customer offer over time.Key performance indicators compared with previous year:  · Net sales increased by 8 % to MSEK 5 262 (MSEK 4 858).  · Operating profit increased to MSEK 104 (MSEK 21).

This, together with our second projectVP02 (IMiD) for IPF and the associated debilitating cough, means that we havetwo distinctive and differentiated development programs within our portfolio.In early September, we completed a 54-subject phase I dose escalation study withC21. The study established that 200 mg daily has a good safety profile and thatit is the maximum tolerated dose. This dose will be used in our planned phase IIstudies in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and systemic sclerosis (SSc).Moreover, based on receptor binding data, we have concluded that this doseresults in a free C21 plasma concentration that is sufficient to activate theangiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) in our upcoming phase IIa trials. It isalso exciting that we could confirm a dual action through both the AT2 and thethromboxane (TP) receptor. The relative role of the effects of C21 on these tworeceptors will be further investigated, particularly as both mechanisms arerelevant for addressing fibrosis and vasculopathy, giving C21 a unique profilesince also TP receptor activation may contribute to disease manifestations.During the third quarter we filed a phase II CTA (clinical trial application)with the MHRA, the regulatory body in the UK, for studying the effect of asingle dose of C21 on cold induced vasoconstriction in subjects with systemicsclerosis (SSc). This study will enable us to document a direct vasodilatoryeffect of C21 in man which may benefit patients with SSc, as well as patientswith IPF.During the quarter the pharmaceutical formulation development in VP01 progressedahead of schedule allowing us to switch from an oral solution to capsules in theupcoming phase II proof of concept study in IPF. This is a significantadvancement since a capsule formulation is much more nimble for the patient,superior from a logistical point of view and could be used in the commercialsetting if the product reaches the market. The application for the IPF studywith the new formulation is expected to be filed later this year.The formulation work of VP02 continues and progresses in line with our goal forthis year, to identify a formulation with the desired properties. We are in themidst of this optimization and the following step is to carry out toxicologicalwork and then initiate a phase I study  in 2020.On September 27, we reached an important milestone through the up-listing ofVicore’s shares to Nasdaq Stockholm’s main list. This is key to increase theattractiveness of our share longer term, mainly through enhanced liquidity, asthe potential investor base grows significantly.In summary, we continue to build Vicore, at a high pace and with a strong focusto maximize the probability of succeeding with our two main projects and therebyhelping patients with serious lung diseases.Carl-Johan Dalsgaard, CEOThe full interim report is available at:https://vicorepharma.com/investors/financial-reports/For further information, please contact:Carl-Johan Dalsgaard, CEO, tel: +46 (0)70 975 98 63, carl-johan.dalsgaard@vicorepharma.comThis information was submitted for publication on November 8 2019 at 08:00 CET.About Vicore Pharma Holding AB (publ) Vicore Pharma is a Swedish rare disease pharmaceutical company focused oninterstitial lung diseases and related indications.

The organic growth was 2 per cent, mainly driven by increased sales toaffiliated workshops. Adjusted EBIT increased to SEK 231 M, compared with SEK148 M for the year-earlier period.Purchasing synergies on goal, but strong EUR increasing purchasing costsSynergies from the acquisition of FTZ and Inter-Team contributed to lowerpurchasing costs and had a positive effect on gross margin for the quarter.However, the synergies were partially offset by a continued increase inpurchasing prices due to the strong EUR and intensified price competition inseveral of our main markets. As a result of the strong EUR, we will currency-adjust our prices in Norway, Poland and Sweden in the fourth quarter of 2019.The FTZ and Inter-Team business areas have, as previously communicated,generally lower gross margins than the other business areas. This has a negativeimpact on the Group’s gross margin. The overall gross margin for the Group was45.3 per cent (51.3) for the quarter.Improvement in profitabilityOrganic growth in MECA/Mekonomen was 3 per cent in the third quarter and EBITrose to SEK 128 M (116). An intensified pressure on gross margin was compensatedby higher sales and cost savings.In the third quarter, Sørensen og Balchen was negatively affected by continuedweak consumer sales through stores and the organic growth was -6 per cent.Efficient cost control and positive impact from acquisitions in the beginning of2019 supported EBIT for the quarter to remain in line with the year-earlierperiod at SEK 30 M (29).Inter-Team noted favourable sales growth in the third quarter1), mainly drivenby strong growth in the Polish market and a high level of export sales. FTZdeveloped in line with the year-earlier period1) despite a slightly weakerperformance in the market, which was comparable with developments in large partsof the European market.Focus forwardOur focus remains on generating profitable growth in all of our operations andto deliver on communicated strategic projects and initiatives.The ongoing cost-savings programme, which was announced in February 2019,remains on track and had positive impact in the third quarter. Full effect ofSEK 65 M on an annual basis is expected to be reached from the fourth quarter of2019.The merger of MECA’s and Mekonomen’s central warehouses in Sweden is proceedingas planned. During the quarter, we successfully completed pilot deliveries fromthe central warehouse to MECA and we will scale up at a cautious pace, to ensurecontinued high service to MECA's customers. In Poland, we have improvedaccessibility and competitiveness in the southern areas of the country byopening a new regional warehouse in the Krakow area. The merger of the centralwarehouse in Strängnäs and the opening of the regional warehouse in Poland willresult in a temporary stock accumulation in the coming quarters. In parallel,our focus in all parts of the Group is on keeping working capital at a stablelevel.The B2B sales accounts for approximately 90 percent of the total sales.Digitalisation in the Group is high and the main part of B2B sales of spareparts and accessories to workshops and other company customers are made throughdigital flows. When it comes to B2C, sales through e-commerce has increasedsignificantly in recent years.I am convinced that we have great potential to gain market shares and furtherimproving car owners' customer journey through sharpening our digital salesstreams. Our direct digital B2C sales take place through e-commerce in thebusiness areas MECA/Mekonomen and Sørensen og Balchen. In addition, it isimportant to continue to digitise the booking flow for workshop services in allour business areas. We see a great demand from car owners to book workshopservices digitally, with the number of digital bookings increasing significantlyquarter to quarter.Finally, I would like to say that I am proud of the Mekonomen brand, which forthe fifth time over the past six years has been named as the strongest Swedishbrand in the “Car accessories and workshops”2) industry. Even if we areprimarily a distribution company targeting workshops and other corporatecustomers, it is important that we develop our business with a high level ofconsumer insight, where car owners are aware of and have positive associationsto our brands and experience a high degree of customer service throughout thewhole customer journey.Pehr OscarsonPresident and CEO1) FTZ and Inter-Team were acquired on 3 September 2018 and no exact comparativefigures have been calculated for the entire third quarter of 2018 as thecompanies before the acquisition had a different financial year than MekonomenGroup.2) According to an annual consumer survey conducted by Evimetrix concerningbrand awareness and customer satisfaction."
Cavotec SA,2019-11-08 07:00:00,"Cavotec SAInterim report (Q1 and Q3)Cavotec SA – Q319 ReportFurther improved profitability on the back of stable revenuesJuly–September 2019  Order intake increased 36.1% to EUR 50.6 million (37.2)  Revenue decreased -1.5% to EUR 48.4 million (49.2) EBIT excluding non-recurring items amounted to EUR 3.7 million (2.1), corresponding to a margin of 7.6% (4.4%) Non-recurring items amounted to EUR -0.6 million (+0.7), related to restructuring costs Net result for the period was EUR 3.5 million (1.2) Earnings per share basic and diluted amounted to EUR 0.038 (0.016) Operating cash flow amounted to EUR 7.7 million (4.3)January–September 2019  Order book increased 4.7% to EUR 109.6 million (104.7) Order intake decreased -5.7% to EUR 157.8 million (167.3) due to comparison with record high order intake in the first half of 2018 related to a few significant orders Revenue was stable at EUR 148.2 million (148.1) EBIT excluding non-recurring items amounted to EUR 10.1 million (3.8), corresponding to a margin of 6.8% (2.6%) Non-recurring items amounted to EUR 3.0 million (6.5), related to restructuring costs  Net result for the period was EUR 5.7 million (-5.1) Earnings per share basic and diluted amounted to EUR 0.061 (-0.065) Operating cash flow amounted to EUR 5.3 million (-0.5). This includes the Colaco Payment of EUR 8.1 million paid in June Net debt decreased to 32.1 EUR million (FY2018: 53.5)Comment from the CEO Growing order intake and high profitability – transformation winding downOur performance during the third quarter continued to track to our plan for 2019 to focus on profitability by locking in the achieved improvements from the transformation. The quarter thus saw high order intake, further increased profitability and excellent cash generation on the back of stable revenues. The order intake increased 36.1 percent and the order book at the end of the period finished at EUR 109.6 million which is almost 10 percent higher than at the start of the year. We continue to see high activity in the Ports & Maritime sector, especially in the US and Nordics. Order intake increased significantly during the third quarter with Automated Mooring and E-Ferry solutions being especially strong while our Services offerings continued to perform well.This compensated for overall lower activity within the Airports segment, due to several delayed large projects and a mix towards smaller orders, leading to a lower order intake compared to the same period last year. Both the USA and Asia continue to show potential as a result of significant terminal expansions, but we have not yet seen these opportunities materialize into orders. In the Industry segment, the traditional OEMs in Surface Mining and Underground Mining showed a slowing down during the quarter while our service offering continued to grow.The adjusted EBIT increased 72% to EUR 3.7 million for the quarter (2.1) and at EUR 10.1 million for the Jan-Sep period (3.8) is well in line with our announced plan for long-term profitability. The high adjusted EBIT margin at 7.6% for the quarter is explained by the lower cost base resulting from the transformation, but also to a large extent by our continued focus on higher margin business. It is encouraging that despite the focus on quality in our orders revenues have remained stable year over year. It is also a sign of strength that operating cash flow increased 79.5% during the third quarter, to EUR 7.7 million.Cavotec’s transformation is winding down. Our focus for the remainder of the year will be on locking in the improvements achieved, on expanding our Operational and Commercial Excellence programs, continued control of costs and on leveraging on the refocus of our sales force to growing geographies and customer segments, as well as the build up and roll out of our Services offerings. I’m very pleased to say that we continue to follow completely the plan for the transformation of Cavotec that we drew up two years ago and that the performance so far this year is proof of that. I expect us to finish the year with a stable position from which to commence the next phase of our journey.Our strategy for future profitable growth is very clear we will build on a solid foundation of operational and commercial performance to capitalize on our position in terms of mega trends such as environmental concerns, electrification and automation to offer innovative products and solutions that meet our customers challenges in these areas.Lugano, November 8, 2019Mikael NorinChief Executive OfficerENDSQ319 Conference call A conference call for shareholders, analysts and media will be held on 8 November 2019 at 10:00 CET.

In the US, thefederal district court for the District of Columbia ordered the FDA toreconsider ""with deliberate speed"" the application for final approval ofBrixadi™. The pivotal program for CAM2029 was extended with a Phase 3 long-termsafety study and in parallel an autoinjector development was started to furthersimplify self-administration. In addition, a license agreement was signed withRa Pharmaceuticals for a long-acting zilucoplan to treat life-threatening bloodand tissue disorders.Market expansion and growing Buvidal[®] salesIn the third quarter, we saw continued growth in sales of Buvidal[®] fortreatment of opioid dependence in the EU and Australia. Our revenues increasedby 105 percent to 40.2 MSEK compared to the corresponding quarter 2018. Productsales increased by 73 percent to 19.5 million SEK compared to the previousquarter, while the total number of patients on Buvidal[®] increased from about1300 to 2500. Progress continued on the initial launch markets in the Nordics,Germany and the UK. In our first to launch market, Finland, we achieved animpressive market share of about 30 percent of buprenorphine treated patientsand about 20 percent of all patients receiving medication assisted treatment(MAT). The corresponding patient shares in Germany were three and one percent,respectively, indicating a significant growth potential for Buvidal[®].We delivered on the planned expansion into new geographies with the recentlistings of Buvidal[®] for reimbursement in Norway, Australia, Scotland, Walesand Northern Ireland. This was highlighted by the announcement in August by theMinister for Health, Greg Hunt, that the Australian government will invest 40million dollars to give patients access to Buvidal[®], and an additionalproduct, under a PBS listing.[1] We have already seen good initial patientuptake in Norway and Australia and expect an accelerated growth as the awarenessof Buvidal[®] continues to increase.We are well advanced preparing for launches in the next wave markets thatinclude Austria, Italy, Spain and Benelux. Importantly, the feedback fromprescribers and patients continues to be very positive across all markets and wetherefore look positively on the sales development in the fourth quarter andduring 2020.Positive court decision on US exclusivityIn July, Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell of the US District Court for the Districtof Columbia granted Braeburn’s motion for summary judgment, vacating the FDA’sdecision to deny approval of Brixadi™ Monthly and remanding the case to theagency ordering the FDA to reconsider “with deliberate speed” the applicationfor final approval of Brixadi™, raising our hopes that Brixadi™ will soon beavailable to patients with opioid dependence in the US. In parallel, a CitizenPetition was conducted to revoke the orphan drug designation of Sublocade™. Weare pleased with FDA’s 7 November decision to grant Braeburn’s Citizen Petition,thereby eliminating the risk of further market exclusivities blocking Brixadi™from the US market. Braeburn can now focus on preparing for launch in 2020 –paving the way for an effective, individualized, long-acting treatment of opioiduse disorder accessible to US patients. In view of the July 22 district courtruling, we are surprised by FDA’s decision to uphold the tentative approvaldecision to 30 November 2020. However, we do not expect that this will have asignificant impact on the market potential over time. Brixadi™ has a competitiveproduct profile and Braeburn will be well prepared for the upcoming launch.Growing scientific evidence base for Buvidal[®]During the period, all patients completed the treatment phases in the clinicalstudies, DEBUT and UNLOC-T. DEBUT evaluated randomized treatment with Buvidal[®]versus sublingual buprenorphine/ naloxone in 120 outpatients in communitytreatment. UNLOC-T compared non-randomized treatment of Buvidal[®] versusmethadone a total of 129 patients in eight minimum to maximum security prisonsin New South Wales (NSW) and is sponsored by the NSW Ministry of Health. Basedon the study experience, scale up is already initiated in NSW prisons. Resultsfrom the studies will be presented at leading conferences in early 2020, butsignificant interest has already been generated as the study design andbackground data has presented at scientific meetings and conferences. Overall,the awareness of and interest in Buvidal[®] is growing. This is partly due to anincreasing visibility through presentations, special symposia and plenarylectures by addiction experts at different international scientific conferences,including Lisbon Addictions.In parallel with growing the evidence base for Buvidal[®] progress, we havecontinued to advance our development pipeline of innovative medicines fortreatment of other severe and chronic diseases.Preparing for submission in chronic painWe believe our long-acting buprenorphine depots, CAM2038, also has the potentialto address unmet medical needs in the area of chronic pain, by combining aneffective, round-the clock, long-acting pain relief with a reduced risk ofmisuse, illegal diversion and overdosing, During the third quarter, we have beenpreparing for health authority meetings to discuss the planned regulatorysubmissions planned in e.g. the EU during the first half of 2020.Phase 3 program expanded for CAM2029The pivotal Phase 3 program for our long-acting octreotide depot, CAM2029 fortreatment of acromegaly, was during the quarter expanded with a 52-week Phase 3study to assess the long-term safety of CAM2029 in both new patients andpatients transferred over from the randomized 24 week efficacy study. Thesestudies will include in total about 140 patients across about 55 clinics in theUS and Europe. We currently expect recruitment to be completed during 2020,while efficacy results are expected in 2021. During quarter, we also completeddesign and study protocol development for the pivotal registration program ofCAM2029 in patients with neuroendocrine tumors, NET, and are continuing toevaluate other potential indication areas. Third party market assessmentsperformed during the quarter indicate a market potential for CAM2029 of up to1,2 billion dollars per year acromegaly and NET, depending on final productpresentation and supporting clinical data.[2] In parallel with theseassessments, we have initiated the development of an autoinjector for CAM2029,as a complement to the existing prefilled syringe presentation.Growing pipeline with own programs, ongoing partnerships and new licenseagreementsDuring the period, we also advanced early stage clinical and preclinicalprograms. Phase 2 preparations for the treprostinil extended release depot,CAM2043, for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and Reynaud'sphenomenon, is well advanced, but study starts has for internal capacity reasonsbeen pushed to next year. In the collaboration with Rhythm, CAM4072 for thetreatment of genetic obesity disorders, a Phase 2 study is currently ongoing andis expected to be completed during the first half of 2020. In August, Rhythmannounced positive results from a pivotal Phase 3 study of daily dosedsetmelanotide in patients with obesity caused by pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) orleptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency. This was good news also for the weeklysetmelanotide formulation, supporting both safety and efficacy.During the quarter, we also signed a license agreement with Ra Pharmaceuticalsfor the development of a long-acting zilucoplan depot for treatment ofgeneralized myasthenia gravis, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, and othertissue-based complement-mediated disorders. Preparations for start of clinicaldevelopment during 2020 are ongoing. After the period, it was announced that theBelgian pharmaceutical company UCB has put a bid to acquire Ra Pharmaceuticalsfor 2.5 billion dollars.Strong third quarter and positive outlookDuring the third quarter, we continued the transformation of Camurus from a R&Dfocused company to a science lead pharmaceutical company with an own commercialinfrastructure in the EU and Australia.In the three quarters since the first commercial sale, I am proud of ourexcellent and dedicated teams and their significant achievements in establishingan efficient distribution chain and sales of Buvidal[®] across our markets inthe EU and the Australia. Pricing and reimbursement has been successfullysecured in our first wave markets, supported by a robust and growing scientificevidence base for Buvidal[®]. We have also initiated new reimbursementapplications and initiated launch activities to make our innovative, long-actingtreatments available to patients in the next wave markets. We have madeexcellent progress in our R&D programs and look forward to a strong and positivenews flow during the coming quarters.Fredrik TibergPresident and CEOReferences1) Media Release 25 August 2019, https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-greg-hunt-mp/media/pbs-support-for-end-of-life-care-and-opioid-dependency2) Globe Life Sciences reports 2019 data on fileFor more information:Fredrik Tiberg, President and CEOTel. +46 (0)46 286 46 92fredrik.tiberg@camurus.comFredrik Joabsson, Chief Business Development OfficerTel. +46 (0)70 776 17 37ir@camurus.comThis information is information that Camurus AB is obliged to make publicpursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Swedish Securities MarketsAct.

(a split 3:1 was carried out in June2019).CEO COMMENTSIn summary, Troax shows a strong result for the third quarter of 2019. We cansee that order intake is in line with previous year, an indication that themarket is not currently growing. During this quarter, we have noted continuedweak activity from the automotive sector, mainly affecting China and the US(Folding Guard). There has been an increased order intake in Europe, which weinterpret as our continuing to take share of a market that is showing weak ornegative growth. Thanks to the good order intake during the second quarter,sales growth in this third quarter was 6%, which also had a positive impact onboth gross margin and profit. We have again received several important ordersfrom customers in automation, warehousing and property protection and we havealso received interesting orders in the automated warehouse sub-segment,although this is not at the same level as in the previous quarter.As previously, we are still devoting a great deal of time and effort into theintegration and improvement of our Folding Guard unit in Chicago. As announcedearlier, we have seen positive changes in 2019 and we have switched toconcentrating on increasing our marketing and sales efforts. This should startto have positive effects from 2020. The result for Folding Guard in the quarteris still clearly below our targets although it has improved during the year. TheUS market was again good in the third quarter (excluding automotive) and it ispositive to note a good development for sales under the Troax brand. Theindication is still that most customers have well-filled order books andactivity levels have been high, although like the trend since the end of lastyear, market growth has levelled out. We therefore expect the good figures weshowed for the fourth quarter of 2018 will be a challenge in terms of orderintake in the fourth quarter. However, the order backlog at the end of theperiod remained at a high level.Investments in increased production capacity at our plants in Sweden and Italyare proceeding according to plan and the Swedish investment regarding a newpanel production line was put into production just before the summer holidayperiod this year. Investments in expanded warehouse space and improved warehousemanagement for the unit in Hillerstorp are also proceeding according to plan.With these investments, we expect to be well equipped for a continued increasein volume over the next few years. We can also announce a minor change duringthe third quarter we acquired all shares in our former distributor in India andit is now consolidated in operations from September of this year.Net sales increased by 6 per cent in the quarter compared to the correspondingperiod last year. The trend is positive, especially in Continental Europe, theUK and the Nordic countries. The result for the quarter has been positive. Wecontinue to increase sales and marketing efforts according to plan, albeit to aslightly lower extent than in the first quarter. The gross margin is at a goodlevel and has been stable during the third quarter. We continue to have goodcapacity utilization in our facilities in Hillerstorp, Sweden and Calco, Italy.For the Group, the operating margin was 23,2 percent, compared with 21,7 theprevious year. The consolidation of Folding Guard continues to negatively affectthe Group's operating margin. Net profit amounted to 7,3 MEUR for the quartercompared to 6,3 MEUR last year. The improvement is mainly attributable to betteroperating results. Earnings per share for the third quarter are 0,12 EUR,compared with 0,11 EUR for the corresponding quarter of 2018. Working capital isat the expected level. The balance sheet item ""tangible assets"" has increased byabout 6,5 MEUR at January 1, 2019 due to IFRS 16. Cash flow for the quarter isin line with the corresponding period in 2018. Investments were charged to cashflow of 1,5 MEUR in the quarter.Thomas Widstrand, President and CEOTELEPHONE CONFERENCEInvitation to presentation of the second quarter result:Thomas Widstrand, CEO presents the result on a phone conference on the 7th ofNovember 2019 at 16:00 CET.

Already this year, wehave an acquired annual sales in excess of one billion SEK, which far exceedsour target of SEK 600-800 million. Each of the five acquisitions made during thequarter have contributed to Instalco’s strong performance and our geographicexpansion of operations.In Finland, we established our position for the first time in the northern partof the country via the acquisition of the heating & plumbing company, PohjanmaanTaloteknikka in Oulu, which is a city in the region of North Ostrobothnia,Finland.  In Helsinki, we acquired VIP-Sähkö. It specialises in electricalinstallations for new housing construction, which is an area of expertise thatwe previously lacked in Finland.In Sweden, we widened our geographic scope via the acquisition of OVAB OptimalVentilation, which primarily serves the markets of Östersund and Åre. We arealso now represented in Nyköping via the acquisition of Rörtema and we expectmany opportunities for collaboration with our other Instalco companies. InBusiness Area North, we expanded via our acquisition of Milen Ventilation inGävle.Prestigious projects and a stable marketI am proud to report that we signed two major contracts for prestigious projectsduring the quarter. JN El has been contracted by Skanska for electricalinstallations in conjunction with the construction of Scania’s new foundry inSödertälje. The work will be done as part of a collaboration contract where JNEl will be responsible for the electrical installations for approximately SEK100 million. The other major project involves Rörläggaren, which has beencontracted for work associated with the new hospital area in Malmö.

The financing within the joint venture structure is at alower cost of borrowing than the existing senior secured bond frameworks. Thisnot only confirmed the portfolio quality but also enabled DDM to invest theproceeds in further acquisitions.Furthermore, we bought out the co-investor in our Greek non-performing loanportfolio which was acquired by DDM in August 2017. The total investmentamounted to approximately EUR 20M. In September, we also finalized theacquisition of a significant distressed asset portfolio in Croatia with a grosscollection value (face value) of about EUR 200M.These acquisitions have significantly increased the book value of investments by59% compared to 31 December 2018 to EUR 185M.

Part of the net proceeds were used to providea shareholder loan to DDM Debt, which thereby qualifies as equity under thecurrent DDM Debt senior secured bond and revolving loan facility (“RCF”) terms.This strengthens the opportunities for DDM Debt to support continued growth.The headroom under the EUR 27M RCF was EUR 17M at 30 September and is availableuntil March 2021 and cash on hand was approximately EUR 8M at the end ofSeptember 2019.Market outlookWe aim to deliver sizeable and profitable growth as we continue to focus on ourcore markets across Southern, Central and Eastern Europe where we have strongmarket knowledge and relationships.As part of the outlook we target to increase ERC, as we seek to invest in futureacquisitions.

LeoVegas AB,2019-11-07 08:00:00,"“We delivered EBITDA growth of over 40%, which clearly shows that our efficiencyefforts are generating positive results.”– Gustaf Hagman, Group CEOThird quarter 2019: 1 july– 31 september 2019[[[1]]] (http://#_ftn1)  · Revenue increased by 12% to EUR 88.2 m (78.6).  · Organic growth in local currencies was 13%.  · EBITDA increased with over 40% and amounted to EUR 12.7 m (9.0),corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 14.4% (11.4%).  · The number of depositing customers was 334,042 (318,189), an increase of 5%.  · The number of returning depositing customers was 199,023 (177,637), anincrease of 12%.  · Earnings per share were EUR 0.05 (0.13) before and after dilution.Events during the quarter  · LeoVegas was launched in Japan.  · LeoVegas opted to not apply for a gaming licence in the recently re-regulated Swiss market, and therefore the business was closed on 1 July.  · A key payment service provider has chosen to stop offering its service forcertain gaming-related payments on the German market, which affected revenue andnew customer acquisition during the quarter.Events after the end of the quarter  · Preliminary revenue of EUR 26.5 m (26.1) in October, representing growth of1%. October was affected by an exceptionally low game margin. With a normalizedgame margin, revenues had amounted to approximately EUR 28.5 m and a growth rateof 9 percent.  · LeoVegas was initially granted a two-year gaming licence in Sweden – adecision that was appealed. The administrative court has now ruled in thecompany’s favour, increasing the licence period from two to five years.  · LeoVegas has received a sanction by the Netherlands Gambling Authority. Thedecision is in line with the sanctions previously issued for other gamingcompanies.  · The LeoVegas Group’s investment company LeoVentures has entered into anagreement to sell the subsidiary Authentic Gaming to Genting. The sales price isEUR 15 m on a debt-free basis.COMMENT FROM GUSTAF HAGMAN - GROUP CEOThird quarter 2019We continued to show progress during the third quarter in a difficult-to-navigate environment and generated double-digit growth in both sales andoperating profit. Greater regulatory complexity in several of our main marketshas given rise to certain short-term challenges but is also raising the barriersto succeed in the sector which benefit established companies.LeoVegas today has a much more even distribution of revenue across severalmarkets and brands where half of our revenue is derived from locally regulatedmarkets, which contributes to greater stability and lower business risk.Meanwhile, we continue our efforts to execute our strategy of innovation,expansion and profitability.Revenue during the third quarter amounted to EUR 88.2 m (78.6), representingorganic growth of 13%. Growth was favourable during the period in most of ourmarkets, including Sweden where we are gaining market shares, but also in keymarkets such as Finland, Denmark and Italy. The UK is profitable at Group levelbut remains challenging, where Royal Panda in particular had poorer performanceduring the quarter. Excluding the UK, the Group’s organic growth was 27%. Intotal we invested less than planned in marketing during the quarter, which iscoupled to our data-driven and ROI-based marketing model. We chose to not applyfor a licence in Switzerland, where we stopped accepting business on 1 Julybased on commercial rationale. Meanwhile in Germany we are facing challengesrelated to the elimination of a key payment solution, which is affecting bothour revenue and new customer acquisition during the quarter.EBITDA for the third quarter totalled EUR 12.7 m (9.0), corresponding to anEBITDA margin of 14.4% (11.4%). We grew EBITDA by more than 40% during thequarter despite a higher burden from gambling taxes and greater regulatorycomplexity compared with previous years. Our focus on efficiency and costcontrol continues to generate the desired results. As a concrete example of ourefficiency enhancement, our staffing has remained essentially unchanged for thepast year despite greater business complexity, adding more markets and morebrands, while we continue to generate good underlying growth. We continue torenegotiate our supplier agreements in gaming, payments, marketing andtechnology. Through scalability and efficiency we are creating scope to investin growth combined with improved profitability.SwedenLeoVegas was initially granted a two-year gaming licence in Sweden – a decisionthat was appealed. The Administrative Court has now ruled in our favour,entailing that the licence period has been changed from two to five years. Atthe same time, our returning customers in Sweden are at all-time-high, which isproof that our focus on the product and customer experience coupled with acommitment to responsible gaming is paying off in a regulated environment.We estimate that channelisation of online casino in Sweden is far below theSwedish Gambling Authority’s goal of 90%. We therefore look positively upon thefact that the Gambling Authority to a greater extent has begun prioritisingmeasures to curb unlicensed actors. This is needed to ensure that the market’sregulation is successful and results in greater consumer protection.MarketsThus far during the year LeoVegas has launched operations in five new markets,where Japan is the most recent addition. We want to especially highlight thelaunch in Spain, which so far has exceeded our expectations. The online growthin Spain is considerable, and we are highly confident that Spain can become oneof our key markets.During the quarter LeoVegas was issued a fine by the Netherlands GamblingAuthority, in line with the fines that were previously issued to other gamingcompanies. The amount has been expensed in its entirely in the income statement.We are in compliance with the current regulations and will appeal this decision.We remain confident that we will be awarded a licence once the market is opened– mostly likely at the start of 2021.LeoVenturesLeoVentures has entered into an agreement to sell the subsidiary AuthenticGaming for EUR 15 m on a debt-free basis. The buyer is Genting, one of theworld’s largest land-based operators. Authentic Gaming generated approximatelyEUR 1 m in revenue during the third quarter, while the effect on EBITDA wasneutral. The transaction shows how we can successfully invest in, grow andrealize value in our portfolio companies. In connection with this sale we havealso concluded our strategic evaluation of LeoVentures and will continue todevelop the remaining portfolio companies Pixel.Bet and Casinogrounds.Comments on the fourth quarterRevenue for the month of October totalled EUR 26.5 m (26.1), representing growthof 1%. The gaming margin in October was lower than normal, with a number oflarge winners, while Germany is affected by payment limitations. Underlyinggrowth during October remained solid, which is confirmed by a positive start inNovember. With a normalized game margin in October, revenues had amounted toapproximately EUR 28.5 m, with a growth rate of 9 percent.Our current assessment is that marketing costs will increase during the fourthquarter over the third quarter, both in relation to revenue and in absolutefigures. This is in line with the seasonal pattern, where LeoVegas normallyinvests the most in marketing during the fourth quarter.Finally, I want to remind about the half-yearly dividend payment of SEK 0.60 pershare to our shareholders on 6 December.Presentation of the report - today at 09:00 CET  · To participate in the conference call, and thereby be able to ask questions,please call one of the following numbers: SE: +46 (0) 8 50 69 21 80, UK: +44 (0)20 71 92 80 00, US: +1 63 15 10 74 95, Confirmation code: 9566914 or join at theweb at https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/cgmbbfh8This information is information that LeoVegas AB (publ) is obliged to makepublic pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014.

The slow-down that we face across some clients and markets continued over summer andresults have therefore been lower than expected in Q3 as well. While thesereduced spendings across some clients, markets and categories have an impact onour numbers at the moment, we do not see them as a wider structural challenge.Margins are on similar levels as in recent quarters and like last year, thesmaller deviations are due to seasonality and smaller changes in the productmix.Costs have been slightly lower and adapted to the cool down of our business, butin general costs are on the same level as in recent quarters and like last yearas well.Despite the slight slowdown in spring and summer we generally develop accordingto our plans and we continue on our mission to continuously improve our businessby creating growth for our clients and partners.”Contact informationMatthias Stadelmeyer, President and CEO, telephone +46 8 405 08 00Viktor Wågström, CFO, telephone +46 8 405 08 00E-mail: ir@tradedoubler.comOther informationThis information is information that Tradedoubler AB is obliged to make publicpursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Swedish Securities MarketsAct.

We improved our operative EBITA margin and the rolling 12-monthsgross margin continues to gradually recover. Our operating cash flow wasstronger, compared both to last year’s quarter and year to date.As part of the strategic evaluation of Eltel’s operations outside the Nordics,we have divested our Polish Communication business, which will give a totalproceeds of about EUR 12 million. A divestment of the German Communicationbusiness is ongoing and we have concluded that we will retain the Polish andGerman Power businesses for the time being, while we continue the work toincrease their profitability. The planned divestment of business area Aviation &Security to Luftfartsverket is proceeding according plan and both partiesundertake to ensure a definitive agreement is signed no later than the firstquarter 2020. The definitive agreement is however conditional on approval by therespective party’s board, the Swedish Competition Authority and the SwedishGovernment.In our daily operations, we continue to make improvements in both the Power andCommunication segments. We are improving the quality of deliveries and services,particularly to our largest customers and we can see positive results from theOperational Excellence strategy, especially in the Nordic markets. However,these quality improvements have increased our production cost in the short term,especially in the areas where we have had delayed execution of orders.In Power, the expected lower net sales in Smart Grids as well as write downs inHigh Voltage and in the Swedish business impacted the result negatively duringthe quarter.In Communication, the result improved from last year, despite lower net salesoverall. The improvement is mainly driven by increased net sales in Norwaycombined with product mix and efficiency improvements. Both the Norwegian andthe Danish markets are growing, and we see improved efficiency in bothcountries. In general, we can say that all Communication markets except Swedencontributed positively to the result during the quarter.In Communication, the Swedish volumes are declining even faster than weanticipated in the second quarter. Our largest Swedish customer has drasticallyreduced its investment levels and we need to adapt to the situation. In thePower segment, we see a similar trend in High Voltage Poland. We will need toright size both businesses and that will come with a cost and is likely to leadto a prolonged transition period for the Group.Going forward, we will continue to focus on our Operational Excellence strategyin our daily operations in order to increase profitability. At the same time, wewill also continue to strengthen our balance sheet and lower the net debt level.Casimir Lindholm, President & CEOFor further information, please contact:Petter Traaholt, CFOTel. +46 72 59 54 749, petter.traaholt@eltelnetworks.seElin Otter, Director, Communications and Investor RelationsTel. +46 72 59 54 692, elin.otter@eltelnetworks.seEltel AB discloses the information provided herein pursuant to the EU’s MarketAbuse Regulation and the Securities Markets Act.

Today I’m therefore pleased to report our strongest ever thirdquarter. Net sales increased 26 per cent over the previous year with a goodcontribution from the newly acquired inhalation business.  Organic growth was 11per cent and we see strong growth across all three business segments and in allgeographies where we operate.EBITDA increased 87 per cent and in addition to acquisitions we report goodcontributions from serialisation, newly expanded capacities and our globaldevelopment services. For non-lyophilized injectables I’m still not satisfiedwith the performance, but we are making progress on our improvement plan. Stockbuilding in preparation for Brexit in our UK inhalation business generatedapproximately 10 per cent EBITDA increase.EBITDA-margin in the normally weak third quarter increased significantly to avery satisfactory 15.7 per cent, whereof 1.3 percentage points was due to newaccounting standards.As earlier in the year we report strong cash flow and good cash conversion.Despite high sales growth we continue to keep working capital almost flat.

For example, we strengthened thecommercial organisation, started to anchor our health economics studies,attended major trade fairs, had a positive follow-up meeting with the FDA on ourstudy plan, made preparations for our regulatory studies and, last but notleast, held intensified discussions with potential partners.A large and important element of this work was strengthening the commercialorganisation. We recruited a highly experienced Chief Commercial Officer, ThomasFritz, who in previous roles has successfully driven results in both mature andemerging markets. He has already proven himself a major asset ahead of ourlaunches in Europe and the US. At the start of the year we also employed anequally experienced Chief Medical Officer, Tiziana Di Martino (MD, MSc, MBA),who has already conducted several in-depth interviews with clinics and doctorsto help us gain even better understanding of our market. The feedback we havereceived to date has been incredibly positive, particularly on our comprehensiveantibiotics panel. This feedback has come not only from the laboratory managerswe work with, but also from administering physicians.We have now started to anchor our health economics studies with the clinicallaboratories that we are in contact with and we will soon choose thelaboratories that we want to work with. We intend to start the first healtheconomics study in the second half of 2020. Our preparations for the clinicalstudy are proceeding according to plan and we have now obtained all the isolatesthat we need.The positive feedback we have received also came from the trade fairs we visitedduring the quarter. We attended IDWeek in Washington and the Annual Meeting ofthe American Association of Clinical Chemistry (AACC) in California. We did notexhibit at these events but participated as visitors. I believe that awarenessof Q-linea is relatively high, with particularly high curiosity about our broadoffering. Many see that the capacity and potential of our ASTar® system issignificantly higher than what is currently found in the market. In mid-Novemberwe will exhibit at the FIS, Federation of Infection Societies Conference, inEdinburgh, which was especially interesting since the UK is far advanced interms of infection diagnostics and antimicrobial resistance.We have mostly received highly positive feedback regarding ASTar, particularlyfrom the in-depth interviews we conducted both in Europe and the US. We havealso learnt that clinics and physicians want to see Meropenem-Vaborbactam (MER-VAB) included in our antibiotics panel. This would provide more comprehensiveanalytical results for patients with resistant bacterial infections. Greaterresistance to antibiotics has meant that combination therapies have becomeincreasingly common and important for treating patients with resistant bacterialinfections. The added value provided by MER-VAB is therefore consideredsubstantial, which is why we are now taking measures to include it in ourantibiotics panel.Discussions with potential sales partners intensified considerably during thequarter. We are holding discussions with the most interesting companies in themarket and, as promised, I am looking forward to presenting an agreement withfuture sales partners at the end of the year. Interest in ASTar is widespreadsince the system stands out from all other systems. Isolates, semi-automaticsystems or high value – no matter which it is, ASTar can address all thesefactors with accurate MIC values. No other product can do this. The capacity ofour system is unique and our reference samples are of the highest class.For a couple of months we have had three alpha systems operational, essentially24 hours a day, seven days a week. The ASTar system has, quite simply, beenthoroughly tested. Overall, the results have been positive, but an importantcomponent that we purchase from a third-party manufacturer has shown errors at ahigher rate than we deem acceptable. The reliability of the component needs tobe improved and we have postponed our schedule so as to jointly solve the issuetogether with the supplier.We do not believe this affects the positive discussions we have with ourpotential future sales partners. Furthermore, we do not see that it affects theCE marking of the system. However, it does mean that our clinical studies in theUS and Europe are expected to begin in the second half of 2020 instead of thefirst quarter of 2020 as previously anticipated. ASTar will be presented atECCMID in Paris. This is a more traditional launch strategy with a longer testperiod of ASTar before commercial launch.After the end of the quarter, we also received a highly positive response fromthe FDA regarding our proposed clinical study in the US, allowing Q-linea toperform parts of the study itself based on the high educational level of ourclinical microbiologists. The FDA’s proposal to change the design of the qualitycontrol process during the study could also result in a shorter developmentperiod for our planned product for semi-automatic isolate analysis, which isnaturally also very positive.Of course, it feels disappointing to postpone our clinical studies and thelaunch of ASTar, but overall the quarter has been positive and the feedback fromthe FDA was highly gratifying. We have taken many important steps to make ASTarready for approval and launch to market. The feedback we are receiving both frompotential customers and in discussions with possible partners is very positiveand fills us with enthusiasm. I look forward towards the journey ahead togetherwith you all.Uppsala, November 2019Jonas Jarvius, PresidentThis report has been prepared in a Swedish original and an English translation.In the event of any discrepancies between the two, the Swedish version is toapply.PresentationQ-linea invites investors, analysts and the media to an audiocast andteleconference (in English) today, 7 November, at 1:00 to 2:00 p.m. (CET).President Jonas Jarvius and CFO Anders Lundin will present Q-linea, comment onthe interim report for the January to September 2019 period and respond toquestions.Webcast: https://tv.streamfabriken.com/q-linea-q3-2019Telephone number for the teleconference: SE: +46856642705 UK: +443333009262US:+18338230586Upcoming reporting dates13 February 2020       Year-end report, Q4     January to December 2019Week of 13 April 2020  Annual Report 2019      January to December 20197 May 2020             Interim report, Q1      January to March 202026 May 2020            Annual General Meeting16 July 2020           Interim report, Q2      January to June 20205 November 2020        Interim report, Q3      January to September 2020About thecompanyQ-linea AB(publ)Corporate      556729-0217Reg.

Bactiguard Holding AB,2019-11-07 07:30:00,"The new license agreement with Zimmer Biomet contributed to that we deliveredthe strongest quarter to date for Bactiguard as a listed company. Thepartnership with one of the three largest orthopedic companies in the worldconfirms the strength of Bactiguard's technology in a global perspective and anew medical application for long-term use. The financial impact of the agreementalso shows that our growth strategy works.Third quarter (July-September 2019)  · Revenues amounted to SEK 67.0 (35.7) million, whereof new license revenuesfrom the agreement with Zimmer Biomet accounted for SEK 29.4 million and most ofthe increase.  · BIP sales amounted to SEK 8.7 (3.9) million, an increase of 120% essentiallyattributable to China, but India also had good growth.  · EBITDA amounted to SEK 36.5 (7.9) million, with an EBITDA margin1 of 54%(22%). The sharp improvement in earnings and margin was primarily driven by thenew license revenue.  · Operating profit amounted to SEK 25.9 (-0.2) million.  · Net profit/loss amounted to SEK 23.7 (-0.5) million, or SEK 0.71 (-0.02) pershare.  · Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to SEK 22.0 (4.1) million, orSEK 0.66 (0.12) per share.Nine-month period (January-September 2019)  · Revenues amounted to SEK 136.2 (121.0) million. The increase was mainlydriven by new license revenues from both Zimmer Biomet and Well Lead.  · BIP sales amounted to SEK 14.9 (26.1) million.  · EBITDA amounted to SEK 49.4 (18.8) million, with an EBITDA margin of 36%(16%).  · Operating profit amounted to SEK 17.8 (-6.9) million.  · Net profit/loss for the period amounted to SEK 14.7 (-9.4) million, or SEK0.44 (-0.28) per share.  · Operating cash flow for the period amounted to SEK 12.5 (0.1) million, orSEK 0.37 (0.00) per share.Key events during the third quarter  · Bactiguard signs global license agreement with Zimmer Biomet  · New major order from China  · Bactiguard’s central venous catheters approved in Mexico  · New Chief Medical and Technology Officer  · Bactiguard’s urinary catheters approved for reimbursement in the DutchmarketKey events after the end of the third quarter  · Nomination Committee appointedComments by the CEOBactiguard’s strongest quarter to dateThe new license agreement with Zimmer Biomet contributed to that we deliveredthe strongest quarter to date for Bactiguard as a listed company. Thepartnership with one of the three largest orthopedic companies in the worldconfirms the strength of Bactiguard's technology in a global perspective and anew medical application for long-term use. The financial impact of the agreementalso shows that our growth strategy works.Total revenues for the quarter nearly doubled, generating an EBITDA margin of 54percent, a net profit of close to SEK 24 million and an operating cash flow ofSEK 22 million. Despite a weaker start of the year, EBITDA margin was 36 percentand net profit close to SEK 15 million, which I see as a token of strength.Licensing businessRevenues from Becton, Dickinson & Company (BD) were slightly lower this quarter,but year to date, accumulated sales were in line with last year and theunderlying business is stable.The licensing deal with Zimmer Biomet, one of the world's largest orthopediccompanies with global sales of close to USD 8 billion in 2018, generated newlicense revenues of USD 3 million in the quarter. As we reach certain milestonesin the US regulatory process, the agreement can generate additional revenue ofUSD 2 million in total. When the products reach the market, Bactiguard willreceive royalty revenue based on Zimmer Biomet's sales. In the regulatoryprocess, the technical file and clinical evidence of the trauma implant that wasCE-marked at the end of 2018 will be used as a reference, which will facilitateand shorten the process. It is also clear that this CE mark has been of greatimportance in the negotiation with Zimmer Biomet as it shows that the technologymeets the EU requirements for patient safety, among other things.The products marketed by Vigilenz Medical Devices, our licensing partner fortrauma implants in Southeast Asia, have now reached the market in Malaysia andwill gradually start to generate both new clinical evidence and recurringlicense revenues for Bactiguard.The preparatory work with Well Lead to register our entire portfolio of productsin China has almost been concluded. Thereafter, the regulatory process begins,and we expect it will take another couple of years before locally produced BIPproducts are approved for sale in China.BIP portfolioAfter a weak start of the year, BIP sales more than doubled in the thirdquarter. Nevertheless, we have not yet reached the same accumulated level aslast year. China plays a major role in this comparison. Last year, we deliveredlarge volumes of products to our new partner Well Lead in conjunction with thesigning of a new license and distribution agreement. In the third quarter ofthis year, we received the first Chinese order outside the initial agreement.This was an important milestone as it shows that end-customer sales are pickingup. Well Lead continues to establish regional distributors for broader marketcoverage and the transfer of existing customers from our former distributor isongoing, but it has taken longer than expected. At the same time, we arestrengthening our local organization to support Well Lead in its marketingefforts.In India, too, we are beginning to see greater activity in the market as ourpartner has strengthened its sales organization and increased activities towardsboth private and public hospitals. The Middle East is also developingpositively, and we have finally started launching in Egypt after major delays inthe regulatory and administrative process. In Europe, the markets where we havebeen present for a long time are developing very well, while it is taking timeto increase our footprint in new markets. We have relatively recently changedpartners in Germany and this year also in Italy. At the same time, we haveestablished new partnerships for Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Iestimate that it takes at least take one to one and a half years for a newcollaboration to start delivering clear results, so we need to be patient with asomewhat lumpy sales development.We have recently strengthened the medical competence in management with StefanGrass, physician and researcher with specialist expertise in anaesthesia andintensive care. He is genuinely development-oriented, with extensive clinicalexperience of the product portfolio Bactiguard offers and the complicationshealthcare related infections lead to, both for patients and healthcareproviders, and we already see that he has a lot to contribute.It is with pride that I sum up a quarter with strong earnings and profitability,confirming that our growth strategy works.

Railcare Group AB,2019-11-07 07:30:00,"Strong earnings and continued high sales growth in the third quarterThird quarter[1]  · Consolidated net sales increased by 62.1 per cent to SEK 101.0 million(62.3).  · Operating profit (EBIT) increased by SEK 21.4 million to SEK 16.8 million(loss 4.6).  · Earnings per share after dilution amounted to SEK 0.50 (loss 0.21).First nine months of the year[1]  · Consolidated net sales increased by 44.7 per cent to SEK 277.1 million(191.5).  · Operating profit (EBIT) increased by SEK 31.1 million to SEK 30.5 million(loss 0.6).  · Earnings per share after dilution amounted to SEK 0.86 (loss 0.08).Significant events in the third quarter  · The first test run of the innovative new MPV, an emissions-free, battery-poweredMulti Purpose Vehicle, was successfully conducted during the quarter.CEO’s commentsDuring the third quarter, we have achieved a pre-tax profit (EBIT) of SEK 16.8million and a turnover of SEK 101 million, which gives a margin of 16.6 percent.We have continued to have good sales and earnings in the Construction Sweden,Transport Scandinavia and Construction Abroad segments.Compared to the previous year's third quarter, we have significantly highervolume and earnings. Volume growth of 62 per cent and an operating profit of SEK21.4M million are largely due to increased volumes in Construction Sweden,Transport Scandinavia, with the project to transport iron ore for Kaunis Iron,and the increased utilisation in the UK, Construction Abroad.In general, the Group now has good growth and profitability in our home marketsin Sweden and the UK, and despite the fact that Trafikverket has announced somecancelled projects[2], this is not something that has affected us as theseprojects are for completely different types of products. Since we mostly workwith planned maintenance and a great focus is there, we also have a good andstable order portfolio ahead. Trafikverket has announced major investments inrail maintenance ahead with a focus on planned maintenance such as trackreplacements, switches, and ballast changes, projects that are completely inline with what our machines can offer. Trafikverket’s national plan continuesfor 10 years and volumes for rail maintenance will increase further in thefuture.In the Construction Sweden segment, we have had a high utilisation rate on allmachines and the focus is on production, safety, and quality. The work we havedone is largely cable handling and ballast changes for upcoming trackreplacements around the country. For the future, we have a lot of preparatorywork on the construction segment before the track replacements begin on 15[]November. From 15 November to 15 March, we will be fully engaged in the snowremoval with the agreement we have with Trafikverket. After that we start againwith preparatory work for the upcoming track replacement projects, we havereceived six call-offs in the Trafikverket agreement, which means that we have agood utilisation until July 2020. This is an exceptionally good prospect for ouroperations on the construction segment in Sweden.A good quarter for the Transport Scandinavia segment with increased growth andearnings compared to the previous year's third quarter. The transport of ironore to Kaunis Iron goes according to plan and we also ran some extra transportsof iron ore during the quarter. This creates a good foundation and stability forthe segment. The agreement with Kaunis Iron is for five years and we have nowcompleted the first year of the agreement. For the other transport operations,we have delivered locomotive services and contracted transport in the form ofconstruction machinery and sleepers to contractor companies that carry out trackreplacements. The workshop has had normal occupancy for the quarter. Followingthe reorganization, we have now refined our operations by starting a new companyin the workshop in Långsele, Railcare Lokverkstad AB, which is structurallylocated under Railcare T AB.In the Construction Abroad segment, the third quarter within the UK was betterthan last year's third quarter. Generally, there are slightly lower volumesduring the hottest months of July and August, when the customer Network Raildoes not plan as much work during that period as they want to avoid trackcurves, known as buckling.During the quarter, we worked on the following routes London North East and EastMidlands, London North West and the South East. During the quarter, we trainedmore operators for operations in the UK. Both Swedish and English operators arenow trained and working on projects to learn how to operate the machines inreality. We have done this to meet the announced number of jobs coming duringCP6, ie from1 April 2019 and five years on. Many calls-offs have already been made againstthe framework agreement during the period 2019 and 2020 and for the future.In the Machine Sales segment, the restructuring has now been completed and as of1 October, new Railcare Machine AB with a workshop in Skelleftehamn, and adepartment for Innovation and Design and Sales, is in full swing.The main focus right now is to build the five generator wagons ordered byInfranord[3]. Two wagons will be delivered to the customer during November. Theother three generator wagons will be delivered during the first half of 2020.There is also a full focus on the development and completion of the newinnovation MPV, an emission-free battery-powered Multi-Purpose Vehicle. In earlyOctober, the first tests were carried out in the workshop in Skelleftehamn.During the first test run, we found, among other things, that the noise leveldrops by 15-20 dB compared to diesel engines, which is very pleasing.A third quarter with strong earnings and continued strong sales growth. It issatisfying that the volumes of jobs are increasing in our home markets in Swedenand the UK and that we are performing the jobs with the same high productivity,quality, and safety and that we see a long-term commitment to rail maintenancefrom our customers for many years to come. There is a great demand for ourproducts around the world and not least the emission-free Multi-Purpose Vehiclethat we are developing right now, where we are the first in the world to build abattery vehicle on the rail of this size.With innovative solutions for the railways and with our staff as our primaryresource, we are building the future of Railcare.Daniel ÖholmCEOThis information is information that Railcare Group AB (publ) is obliged to makepublic pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

Garo AB,2019-11-07 07:30:00,"(Interim report July - September 2019 is distributed as an appendix to thispress release)JULY–SEPTEMBER 2019  · Net sales increased 11% to MSEK 235.2 (212.7).  · EBIT amounted to MSEK 23.6 (28.4).  · EBIT margin amounted to 10.1% (13.4).  · Net income was MSEK17.9 (22.7).  · Earnings per share, before and after dilution, amounted to SEK 1.79 (2.27).JANUARY–SEPTEMBER 2019  · Net sales increased 15% to MSEK 730.3 (633.9).  · EBIT amounted to MSEK 76.8 (76.4).  · Net income was MSEK 61.2 (57.2).  · Earnings per share, before and after dilution, amounted to SEK 6.12 (5.72).SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE QUARTER  · GARO signed an agreement with VattenfallPATRIK ANDERSSON, PRESIDENT AND CEO:CONTINUED SUCCESS AND INVESTMENTS IN E-MOBILITYGARO continued to report healthy growth during the quarter. Net sales rose 11%to MSEK 235.2 (212.7). Growth continued to be driven by expansion in E-mobilityand also to a significant extent in the product areas Electrical distributionproducts and Project, while Temporary electric installations remained weak.Growth was even between the Sweden business area and in Other markets of 11% and10%, respectively. It is gratifying to see the performance of our base –Electrical distribution products – with growth of 10% for the quarter and 14%for the January – September period, which significantly exceeds the predictedmarket growth for the period.EBIT for the quarter declined compared with the preceding year to MSEK 23.6(28.4), corresponding to an EBIT margin of 10.1% (13.4). This was primarily aresult of unfavorable product mix and currency effects, which squeezed the grossmargin. Continued market investments and organizational reinforcements, mainlywithin the E-mobility product area, have also had a seasonally greater impact oncosts in relation to sales in the third quarter.EBIT for the January – September period amounted to MSEK 76.8 (76.4),corresponding to an EBIT margin of 10.6% (12.0). Adjusted for an item affectingcomparability from the first quarter, EBIT was MSEK 78.8, corresponding to anEBIT margin of 10.8%.MARKET ACTIVITY IN E-MOBILITYThe E-mobility product area continued to demonstrate high activity and grew 27%during the third quarter, driven primarily by Other markets where overall growthwas 51%. In Sweden, “Klimatklivet” and “Ladda-hemma” subsidies were introducedin July to support the construction of charging infrastructure for electric andchargeable hybrid cars. The programmes this year are different than last year’sprogram, and this year’s registration periods were in August and October, whichtemporarily dampened the demand for mainly public charging stations.During the quarter, we signed a contract with Vattenfall for supplying our smartwallbox, GLB+. The agreement includes Norway, the Netherlands, the UK andSweden, which are all strategically important markets for us. The wallbox, whichis an OCPP-compatible wallbox for multiple-family dwellings, workplaces andpublic environments, will be connected to Vattenfall’s cloud charging service“InCharge,” which supports payment, remote control and operational monitoring.MARKET CONDITIONSWe see a strong trend for the E-mobility product area, with further expansion ofthe charging infrastructure in all markets. Demand for construction-relatedproducts in Sweden remains favorable but is expected to slow in 2020 in linewith fewer construction starts. However, the important renovation sector hasbeen deemed stable. The trend in other markets served by GARO is expected toremain favorable. All in all, GARO has a positive view of market conditions,mainly driven by the continued expansion of charging infrastructure.For further information, please contact:Patrik Andersson, President and CEO: +46 (0)76 148 44 44Helena Claesson, CFO: +46 (0)70 676 07 50This information is such information that GARO aktiebolag is obligated topublish in accordance with the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

Gunnebo AB,2019-11-06 08:01:00,"All-time high order intake and strong sales from Entrance Control boosts Groupgrowth in the quarterPresident and CEO Henrik Lange Comments to Q3 2019:I am very satisfied with the strong order intake in the quarter, up 11% on lastyear representing an organic growth of 4%. Sales were also strong in thequarter, up 5% on last year.In Entrance Control, we experienced an all-time high order intake of MSEK 500 inthe quarter, where we have both taken several important airport orders andincluded a quarter of the newly acquired company, Cominfo. Sales in the quartergrew by 25% and will continue on a high level going forward with the good orderstock we now have. The Cominfo acquisition is a good addition to the BusinessUnit and the integration work is following the plan.In Safe Storage, order intake was up 13% and sales were up 8% mainly driven by astrong performance in Asia. One part of our strategy in Safe Storage is to moveinto partnerships for the distribution of safes in Europe. We have developed aconcept for this partnership model and after the end of the quarter, we haveannounced a partnership with Insafe on the UK market. With Insafe as ourdistributor in the UK, we will get an excellent market coverage with a veryprofessional partner. It also gives us an opportunity to grow our business inthe UK market as well as making our fixed costs variable.In Cash Management, order intake was down by 24% where Americas improved fromlast quarter, but the order intake was lower in both Europe and Asia- Pacific &Middle East. Sales were down by 12%. Sales increased to Bank, were flat toRetail whereas sales to CIT partners had a weaker development. We see signs ofimprovement over the coming quarters.In Integrated Security, order intake was down by 15% year-on-year and sales weredown by 4%. In the Americas, sales grew wheras it contracted in the otherregions. We have been working with profit improvement activities in this areawhich are now having a positive effect on the Business Unit’s EBITA.ResultsThe Group EBITA of MSEK 92 in quarter three was in line with last year. TheEBITA margin was 6.7%.Entrance Control continues to deliver very strong results with MSEK 66 in EBITAat 18% margin. Safe Storage also continues to deliver growth in both orderintake and sales. The EBITA result was MSEK 37 at 7% margin. Apart from drivingthe business, focus in the quarter has been on the planned cost-efficiencymeasures and changing the business model to an indirect partnership modelresulting in a new partnership in the UK.Cash Management had a weak result caused by lower sales in the quarter. Theorder intake in the Americas increased, whereas it decreased in the otherregions. For both order intake and sales, the big deviation compared to lastyear was due to phasing of projects to CITs. The EBITA was MSEK 9 at 4% margin.We are addressing the situation and work both on cost and on developing existingand new partners to improve the performance in the coming quarters.In Integrated Security, the order intake and sales grew in the Americas whereasthey contracted in the other regions. Structural measures on right-sizingcontinued and hence the EBITA improved by MSEK 6 and was positive by MSEK 5 inthe quarter.The cost-efficiency programme which was launched in Q2 is progressing asplanned. The programme consists of two main parts: structural changes due to thechange into a global Business Unit structure and continued downsizing mainly inour European business. Costs will be taken in quarter four for the structuralchanges announced, with the full Business Unit structure and changes in Groupmanagement and the related savings to have full effect as from year-end. Thecontinued downsizing in Europe has been mobilised and started to be implementedduring the end of the quarter. Full cost and benefits of this part of theprogramme will appear in the coming quarters. All in all, the programme isrunning as planned to give full effect as from July next year.Rights issue completedThe Gunnebo rights issue has now been completed successfully according to plan.The rights issue has been used for the Cominfo acquisition and also tostrengthen the balance sheet by reducing the net debt. This improved financialstrength will safeguard the implementation of our strategic plan.New global Business Unit structure and Group Executive Team changesDuring the third quarter, we have as planned started the process of implementingour new focused Business Unit structure also in Americas and Asia Pacific,Middle East & Africa. The roll-out process in these regions is on-going and willbe fully implemented in the fourth quarter.As previously announced, I will be replaced as CEO by Stefan Syrén, who willtake up the position as President and CEO as of 7 November 2019.

The good organic sales growth wassupported by North America and Ibero-America, however hampered by the previouslycommunicated contracts losses in Europe. We have the strongest offering ofprotective services and we grew faster than the security market in generalduring the first nine months.In terms of the macroeconomic environment, we see a slowdown in some key marketsduring the second half of 2019. Security solutions and electronic security salesgrew by 11 percent in the first nine months, and now represent 21 percent oftotal Group sales.The operating margin in the third quarter was unchanged at 5.6 percent (5.6). Itwas also unchanged in the first nine months at 5.1 percent (5.1), with a goodperformance in North America and Ibero-America. Labor markets are increasinglychallenging in all our geographies, and managing the price and wage balance willremain a key focus this year as well as going into 2020. The cost savingsprogram in Europe, initiated in 2018, developed according to plan and supportedthe operating margin.The operating result, adjusted for changes in exchange rates, grew with 5percent in the first nine months.Earnings per share in the first nine months was, adjusted for changes inexchange rates and items affecting comparability, slightly behind last yearnegatively impacted by a higher effective tax rate in the US and by a negativenet effect from IFRS 16.Operating and free cash flow improved compared with the first nine months lastyear. Our strong focus on cash management has paid off but remains a keypriority across all business segments.Driving the transformationWe continue to drive the implementation of the two transformation programs thatwill bring increased efficiency, modernization and innovation. While thepositive impact from these programs is still a few years out, we are progressingaccording to plan with the execution.Offering solutions to our clients is a core part of our strategy, and wecontinue to build a stronger capability within technology to enable furthergrowth. Our ambition is to increase security solutions and electronic securitysales, as part of total Group sales, during the coming years. During a time whenwe see slowing growth in some economies yet upward wage pressure, being able tooffer a solution as an alternative to our clients is as important as ever toenhance value to our clients and to manage total cost.During the second half of the year, we are also working with the previouslyannounced key leadership transitions.

Other effects at30 September were total assets MSEK +89 net debt MSEK +93 gearing ratio +9%.President and CEO, David Woolley, comments on the Q3 2019 Interim Report.Market and sales developmentThe Group’s underlying sales were affected by the overall market slowdown in thethird quarter with sales down year-on-year by –19% in the third quarter and by –7% in the first nine months. The reported sales were down year-on-year for thethird quarter and for the first nine months by – 28% and – 17% respectively inconstant currency and including the effect of the previously announced decisionby a global OEM customer to dual source components during 2019. Published marketindices suggest production rates, blended for the Group’s end-markets andregions declined by 2% in the third quarter with both the Americas and Europe &ROW reporting negative growth. Market growth has slowed in each successivequarter this year with the third quarter being the first quarter to report year-on-year market declines, suggesting that the market has now passed its peak.This market decline accentuates year-on-year comparisons, as the third quarter2018 was the peak of the market. The market indices reported a modest increasein demand in the third quarter for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in NorthAmerica whilst demand for trucks in Europe declined. The truck market remainsConcentric’s largest end-market and accounts for 43% of the Group’s sales. OurEuropean and Indian markets reported negative growth in three out of four end-markets this quarter, namely trucks, agricultural machinery and constructionequipment. We have previously discussed how our customers are managing risk andconducting supply chain destocking programs as the market outlook becomes moreuncertain. This trend intensified during the quarter and coupled with weakeningmarket demand these factors had a significant impact on Group sales.Concentric’s sales in North America, Europe and India were down year-on-year inthe quarter while sales in South America and China were slightly up. Sales toall end-markets were lower in the third quarter year-on-year and theconstruction equipment sector was especially weak in both North America andEurope.Concentric Business Excellence – gearing up for the global market slowdownThe strength and impact of the Concentric Business Excellence programme (“CBE”)is equally important to Concentric during these challenging trading conditions.Our management teams have responded quickly to address the downturn in demand,maximising our flexible business model to reduce the cost of capacity throughreductions in headcount and other manufacturing costs. The business has placedyet greater focus on productivity and inventory efficiency. Importantly, ourinvestment in new customer programmes and the development of new electrificationtechnologies have been safe guarded, securing the core business strength readyfor the return of better market conditions. The Group has managed to maintainoperating income at high levels with 19.8% (22.9%) for the third quarter and21.4% (21.3%) the first nine months.Electrification offers Concentric exciting new marketsWe have recently announced an important new order to develop and supply coolantpumps with integral electronic motor drive and intelligent control systems to aleading global OEM for their new energy storage products. This is a landmarkaward and establishes Concentric as a key supplier in the previously untappedglobal energy storage market and further builds on the expertise developedthrough its advanced battery cooling for commercial vehicle applications, againutilising the liquids we are pumping to cool and control the temperature of theelectronics. It also demonstrates our ongoing commitment to innovativetechnology to meet the demands of increasing electrification of flow control.Acquisition opportunitiesOur focus remains on both geographical and technical expansion, but we haverecently escalated our efforts and have given greater attention to opportunitiesthat will increase our penetration of the electrification of transport,construction and industrial sectors, as these offer real revenue growth in bothour current and new markets and are of strategic importance.OutlookLooking forward, the level of orders received in the third quarter indicate thatsales in the fourth quarter 2019 will be similar to sales in the third quarter,even after accounting for the fewer working days in the fourth quarter. Thepublished market indices have been revised down and now suggest that productionvolumes blended for Concentric’s end-markets and regions will remain flat forthe full year and the market forecast for the full year has therefore beenlowered from +2% to 0%. We continue to expect that demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks could weaken still further during the coming quarter. Our continuedfocus on business excellence will help us respond to these challenging marketconditions for both on- and off-highway sectors and the business remainsvigilant and ready to adapt to further changes in customer behaviour. Concentricremains well positioned both financially and operationally, to fully leverageour market opportunities.For further information, please contact:David Woolley (President and CEO) or Marcus Whitehouse (CFO) at Tel: +44 121 4456545 or E-mail: info@concentricab.comThe information in this report is of the type that Concentric AB is obliged tomake public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the SecuritiesMarkets Act.

Order intake is stillincreasing at healthy levels and we noted a rise in gross margin and EBITAmargin. However, the performance among our segments differs more now than in thepast.Nordic remained strong, with good contributions from Norway and Denmark inparticular. It is exciting that growth in Norway is so strong, which is derivedfrom several different electronics companies. In Denmark, it is gratifying tonote the highly positive impact of our acquisition of Multiprint and that ourorder intake has more than doubled year-on-year. Profitability in the acquiredoperation increased through the implementation of NCAB’s better purchase pricesand terms of payment from our factories. Furthermore, the acquisition added anew factory partner.The East segment also performed well, with a sharp rise in order intake andstronger earnings. The improvement in order intake is largely from domesticChinese customers, where we have secured a number of major hi-tech projects as aresult of our close collaboration.USA remains challenging. Just as we were getting our own operations in order,higher tariffs were introduced. Many customers are delaying orders and hopingfor a cut in tariffs, though unfortunately this no longer seems likely. Our newapproved factory in Taiwan has potential moving forward, even if it has onlycontributed small volumes to date.In Europe, the general slowdown of the industrial economy continued, withnegative growth in most of our larger markets, not least in Germany. Despitethis, NCAB reported year-on-year growth in this segment in most countries duringthe quarter. Furthermore, we have not noted any adverse impact on our grossmargins and we have adapted the pace of recruitment to maintain our EBITAmargin.Overall, the Nordic and East segments offset the weak North America and Europesegments but we could nevertheless report continued growth – though at a slowerrate than earlier quarters. Order intake remains strong. It is also gratifyingto see the good synergies from our acquisition of Multiprint in Denmark arerealized and that we have improved our overall earnings compared with the strongthird quarter of 2018.At NCAB, we have learned that an economic downturn also creates opportunitiesfor us. Following the downturn in 2009, we grew sharply in 2010. Such times makeit more difficult for domestic factories in the West, which may be forced toclose, and can likewise affect smaller trading companies. This is an opportunityto gain customers and carry out acquisitions, which strengthens us when theeconomy recovers. Moreover, it can facilitate the recruitment of specialists.Our business model – to not own any factories – proves to be particularly goodin times like these.Hans StåhlPresident and CEO, NCAB Group ABFor further information, please contact:Anders Forsén, CFO +46 (0)8 4030 0051Gunilla Öhman, Head of Investor Relations, +46 (0)70 763 81 25This is a translation of the original Swedish interim report.

Bravida Holding AB,2019-11-06 07:30:00,"Strong order intake and solid margin•    Net sales increased by 5% to SEK 4,638 million (4,437)•    Organic growth was -3% (6)•    The order backlog was 35% higher at SEK 14,507 million (10,746)•    EBITA increased by 3% to SEK 276 million (267)•    The EBITA margin was 6.0% (6.0)•    Profit after tax was SEK 202 million (202)•    Cash flow from operating activities was SEK 65 million (-132)•    Net debt amounted to SEK -2,735 million (-2,062)•    Four acquisitions were completed in the quarter, adding annual sales ofapproximately SEK 265 million•    Basic and diluted earnings per share were SEK 0.99 (1.00)CEO statementDemand for technical service and installations remains good on our markets.Sales increased in the third quarter and Bravida is continuing to grow in thearea of service. The EBITA margin was at the same level as last year. The orderbacklog continued to rise and is at a new record level. The high pace ofacquisitions has persisted, with four acquisitions completed in the quarter.Sales growth through acquisitionsBravida continued to grow in the quarter, with sales rising by 5 percent, ofwhich 7 percent was as a result of acquisitions. Service sales increased by 10percent in the quarter. This is pleasing as our strategy is to increase serviceassignments, which have a lower level of risk and help improve profitability.The market generally remains good, as reflected in strong order intake, whichrose by 25 percent on the same quarter last year. Our order backlog increased byjust over SEK 600 million to a new record high of SEK 14.5 billion.Selective tendering in Finland and the Stockholm area is the main reason for thenegative organic growth in the quarter. In Norway we have also been veryrestrictive in tendering from the business we acquired from Oras. This hasimproved profitability but has temporarily reduced sales and the order backlog.We are seeing a growing trend of partnering agreements in Norway and we have anumber of large projects that are at the design phase and have not yet resultedin any production and are not included in the order backlog until the productionphase has been contracted.Unchanged EBITA margin and good cash flowThe EBITA margin has improved in Norway as a result of systematic work in thebusiness acquired from Oras. In Denmark the margin was unchanged, while inSweden the margin decreased because of project writedowns in Stockholm. TheStockholm business has experienced negative earnings performance for an extendedperiod. A number of measures such as closing unprofitable departments, selectivetendering and a greater emphasis on project management and control have beentaken to improve earnings in Stockholm. In Finland, the EBITA margin declinedbecause of some unprofitable projects and low volumes in some areas. We havealso implemented measures to improve profitability in Finland.Cash flow remained good and cash conversion was 104 percent.Bravida continues to strengthen through acquisitionsOur growth and market position in both service and installation continue tostrengthen through acquisitions. So far this year we have completed 17acquisitions, four of which were in the third quarter and one after the end ofthe period, adding annual sales of almost SEK 1,000 million. These acquisitionsbolster Bravida’s local market positions, complement our business and expand ouroffering.There is still a long list of potential acquisitions that are a good fit forBravida, and our robust financial position with low indebtedness and strong cashconversion means we are well-positioned to carry on growing throughacquisitions.OutlookAs part of our sustainability work we have decided to drastically reduce our CO2emissions. The goal is for 30 percent of Bravida’s service vehicles to be fossil-free by 2025. We are also altering the terms for selecting company cars, makingit much more advantageous to use environmentally sustainable alternatives andcut emissions from our company cars. Reducing our carbon footprint is a priorityand we are placing significant emphasis on reorienting the company’s efforts tohelp achieve global climate targets.Our order backlog remains at a record high and the bulk of it consists of lotsof small and medium-sized installation projects. In the short term, I expectorganic growth to remain low. However, order levels have never been better forBravida, and together with our large service business the order backlog willcontribute to solid sales performance in the long term. Underlying profitabilityalso remains good, so I am positive about our performance going forward.Mattias Johansson, Stockholm, November 2019For further information, please contact:Mattias Johansson, CEO and Group President of Bravida.

Althoughour top line growth is somewhat inflated due to the successful imple­mentationof price increases to mitigate corresponding increases in raw material costs,our underlying growth is very strong and remains higher than the average organicgrowth of approximately 6-7 percent annually demonstrated in recent years. Thisis driven by a good mix between market growth, increased market share and a morefavorable product portfolio driving price realization. Given the increasedproduct prices to consumers, I am particularly pleased to report a quarterlyvolume growth of 4 percent.The strongest growth was generated in the Ready-to-eat product category (31percent) and in the Ready-to-cook Chilled product category (13 percent). Wecontinue to observe a decline in the less profitable Ready-to-Cook Frozenproduct category (-9 percent) and the export category grows at a slower pacethan the categories with better profitability.In term of sustainability and food safety metrics, we strive to be a leader inthe European poultry space. In order to secure further advances in these areas,we have set ambitious long-term targets and intermediate milestones. I amlooking for­ward to reporting our progress in the coming periods. We are alsoputting increased emphasis on communicating our work in these areas and theattractive features of poultry products in general. Several recent consumercampaigns to this end have been very well received, and we see the increasingconsumer awareness of our sustainability metrics with poultry as a positive keydriver for our sales.During the last years we have gained market share in our home markets throughthe introduction of new innovative, healthy products and our focus on improvedsustainability work. I am convinced that these drivers will continue to work inour favor and enable us to sustain significant long-term growth. Scandi Standardis uniquely positioned among our competitors in our home markets. We aregeographically well diversified, have a skilled organization and a robuststructural setup. Based on the improvements made in the third quarter I ampleased to report another step towards the earnings potential inherent in ourbusiness model.As we have previously communicated, we are carrying out significant investmentsin our business in Ireland this year. These investments are part of the overallinvestment program identified in connection with the acquisition in 2017 aimedat in­creasing efficiency, improving animal welfare, food safety differentiationand debottlenecking. For the group, we expect to invest around MSEK 380 in 2019.During the third quarter our net interest-bearing debt increased by MSEK 84 toMSEK 2,535 compared to the end of the second quarter 2019. The in­crease wasdriven by the earn out payment of MSEK 133 paid to the former owners of ManorFarm. When adjusting for this, our net debt de­creased by MSEK 49. Operatingcash flow amounted to MSEK 90 compared to MSEK 18 for the same quarter lastyear. We remain committed to finding a good balance between returning capital toour shareholders and reinvesting into profitable growth.We are carefully following the structural changes in our sector and believe thatwe are ideally positioned to take part of the consolidation of the Europeanpoultry market. We believe the acquisition of Manor Farm is a good example ofhow we can create value and stability for our shareholders. The acquisition hascontributed to further geographic diversification and we are happy with ourcross-country teams’ ability to deliver benefits through exchanging bestpractice within the group.I am pleased with the way Scandi Standard is cur­rently positioned with a robustbusiness model of sustainably produced, healthy products. Based on the currentmarket outlook, I see good opportunities for incrementally improving returns tothe share­holders in the coming periods.Leif Bergvall HansenManaging Director and CEOConference callA conference call for investors, analysts and media will be held on 6 November2019 at 8.30 AM CET.Dial-in numbers:UK: 020 3936 2999Sweden: 010 884 80 16US: +1 646 664 1960Other countries: +44 20 3936 2999Slides used in the conference call can be downloaded at www.scandistandard.comunder Investor Relations.

This is evinced not least by thefact that Latour's industrial operations have seen continued positive growthduring the third quarter despite signs of a global economic slowdown. Our wholly-owned holdings are reporting organic growth in both their order intakes andsales. However, it should be noted that our growth has slowed down from itsprevious high rate and some segments are experiencing a decline in demand, withcustomers reducing stock levels and becoming far more cautious. The fact thatour operations as a whole nevertheless continue to report positive growth isconfirmation that we are well positioned and prepared for a more widespreaddownturn in the economy.During the third quarter, the order intake grew by 13 per cent and, excludingacquisitions and foreign exchange effects, growth was 4 per cent. Sales rose 15per cent during the quarter and, excluding acquisitions and foreign exchangeeffects, growth was 6 per cent. At the end of the quarter, the order backlogamounted to SEK 2,169 m (1,556 m) and was thus up 39 per cent on the previousyear's value. The operating profit for the quarter increased by 16 per cent toSEK 464 m (399 m) with an operating margin of 14.2 (14.0) per cent, which we arevery pleased with.We continue to take a forward-looking perspective and are investing withundiminished strength in product development, sales and marketing in ourbusiness areas to drive growth and further strengthen the positions of ouroperations. Sustainability is a key aspect and critical to underpinning furthergrowth, and we focus sharply on it in all of our business operations. Ourportfolio today comprises companies with long-term sustainable businesses thatoffer the market products that contribute to the building of a better world. Weare committed to the daily challenge of continuously developing sustainablepractices.Our level of acquisition activity during the quarter has been high and ourdetermination to seek out and evaluate new interesting companies has yieldedexcellent results. We acquired three new companies for our industrial operationsin August and September. Swegon acquired the Norwegian company Klimax AS,Hultafors Group acquired CLC based in Los Angeles, USA, and Produal in LatourIndustries acquired SyxthSense in the UK. In October, we also signed anagreement for the acquisition of Caljan, which will become a new business area,and for the acquisition of S+S Regeltechnik to Latour Industries. Read moreabout our acquisitions on page 4.Growth in the stock market was slower in the third quarter compared with thevery strong growth seen in the first six months of the year. Since the beginningof the year, our investment portfolio has increased by 27.6 per cent, adjustedfor dividends and changes in the portfolio, while the benchmark index SIXRXincreased by 23.0 per cent. The net asset value in Latour increased by 29.9 percent to SEK 127 per share in the same period.Several of our listed holdings have, at this point, already reported theirresults. With a couple of exceptions, these reports are good and stable, whichagain corroborates the high quality of the companies in our portfolio.

See definition on pp. 20-21 2. Based on an exchange rate  SEK/USD of 8,93Comments by CEO Torben JörgensenIt has been a great pleasure and responsibility to work as the CEO for Biotagefor close to 14 years, and to finish with such a strong quarter as this is ofcourse nothing but fantastic. Once again Biotage sets new records. Never beforehave the sales been so high. The gross margin and the profitability are also atrecord level. During the quarter Biotage also achieved something that Ipersonally have been looking forward to on a rolling 12 months basis Biotagenow has a turnover of just over one billion SEK.All geographic regions with the exception of Europe are now showing growthexceeding 8 percent. This enables Biotage to approach its financial target anaverage annual organic growth rate of 8 percent measured over a three yearperiod. At comparable exchange rates and adjusted for acquisitions, salesincreased by 8.1 percent in the quarter while the corresponding figure fororganic growth reaches 8.6 percent for the first nine months of the year.The sales in Asia continue to develop positively. We are seeing strong growthall over this region and an outstanding example is China, which now contributes10 percent of Biotage’s global sales.The increased sales are not achieved at the expense of lower profitability. Onthe contrary, Biotage is growing with improved profitability. It is worth notingthat the gross margin for the quarter as well as for the first nine monthsexceeds our strategic goal of 60 percent. For the quarter the gross marginincreased to no less than 62.8 percent.The development of our offering in Industrial products continues to be strong.This product area now constitutes 12 percent of Biotage’s total sales. It isalmost a year since we launched the latest flash-purification platformBiotage[®] Selekt together with the new series of consumables, Biotage[®] Sfär.As these products are part of Biotage’s single largest product area,Purification, it is of course important that the launch is successful. Theproduct area continues to grow, we are gaining market share and we havesucceeded to meet the wishes of our customers in the American pharma industry.Everything has not gone according to schedule and our wishes, however. The newinstrument generation for automatic purification of plasmids, which came toBiotage with the acquisition of PhyNexus earlier this year, will not be launchedduring 2019 as originally planned. We need more time to ensure that the productmeets Biotage’s high quality standards and the launch has therefore beenpostponed to next year.Already in the six months report I wrote that I was looking forward withconfidence to the second half of the year. Now we have one quarter left of 2019and with a strong order book I continue to look positively to the end of theyear. As this is my last interim report as CEO I would like to take theopportunity to thank all coworkers, customers, the Board of Directors and theshareholders who have made this journey possible. Biotage has recruited a verygood successor to me and as previously announced I will continue on the board ofBiotage, and, if the shareholders are willing, as Chairman of the Board forBiotage after the extraordinary general meeting on November 7.Coming financial reportsAn Extraordinary General Meeting will be held on November 7, 2019.The year-end report for 2019 will be issued on February 7, 2020.The Annual General Meeting 2020 will be held on April 28, 2020.The interim report for the first quarter 2020 will be published on April 28,2020.The interim report for the second quarter 2020 will be published on July 17,2020.The interim report for the third quarter 2020 will be published on November 5,2020.The year-end report for 2020 will be published on February 12, 2021.The Annual Report for 2019 is planned to be made public in week 14 2020.All reports are available at Biotage’s website from the above dates.Uppsala November 5, 2019Torben JørgensenPresident and CEOFor further information, please contact:Torben Jørgensen, President and CEO, phone: +46 707 49 0584Erika Söderberg Johnson, CFO, phone: +46 707 20 48 20This information is information that Biotage AB (publ) is obliged to make publicpursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

Our initial, well focused,seismic campaign has identified one drillable prospect and several leads andpotential leads within the new 3D and 2D seismic areas. Details will follow andwe must remember that Block 49 at this stage is in the exploration phase andstill carries geological uncertainty – but we are off to a very good start! Inthe first half of next year, we plan to drill a very interesting explorationwell which we naturally hope will result in a commercial discovery, but alsowill provide data to further enhance our understanding of the petroleumpotential of Block 49.56 is for Block 56, which is the farm in we announced late in October and isstill subject to government approval. Block 56 is very much a Tethys Oilproject, the kind of project we have been trying to secure for some time. Itmakes very good sense technically in that Block 56 is located a mere 200 km fromthe southern border of Blocks 3& 4 and part of the block offers a similargeology to Blocks 3&4. It is a project were Tethys Oil’s technical expertise canmake a real contribution towards future success.Operationally we note that some interesting exploration work has been carriedout by the current operator and Tethys Oil is able to enter the block in time toflow test three wells that have already been drilled. In effect we can take ashortcut and skip the drilling and go straight for the result - the testing ofwells. And worth noting, the ‘entry price’ is quite low. So, if the block worksas we hope, we are about to enter a new block that could have the kind ofpotential that Blocks 3&4 had ten years ago. So, the risk reward ratio isextremely attractive.Needless to say, we will have ample reason to get back to Block 56 in the nearfuture. Just as we will have reason to keep you updated on progress on Block 49in relation to drilling preparation activities and as more information on thetargeted prospect becomes available. But in the meantime, let us return to those13,053 BOPD produced, net to Tethys Oil, during the third quarter from Blocks3&4.Our main asset had another good quarter. Record production followed thecontinued fine tuning of primarily the Ulfa facility but also successfuldrilling of production wells on Shahd field and remedial and maintenance work onthe older fields. Average production costs are well within our expectations andproduction cost per barrel was USD 10.1 for the quarter. Our record productionlevels were slightly offset by the marginally lower oil prices acquiredresulting in revenues and other income of MUSD 40.7 - in line with the secondquarter 2019. Cash flow remain strong and resulted in our net cash positionincreasing during the quarter from MUSD 62.0 to MUSD 71.9.On the exploration side, the well Maather-1 is currently drilling whereas theYusr-1 well has completed drilling and encountered oil shows. However, Yusr-1did experience some difficulties during drilling and testing operations.Although the well indicated good oil shows while drilling testing has so farbeen inconclusive, but work continues and we remain hopeful of a successful welltest later this year.But for now, let us rejoice in the 13,053 BOPD and all the other activities weoffer. And also do not forget the second part of the 2019 dividend, SEK 1.00 pershare, that is payable in November.Stay with us – it has been a few years since we had this much activity to offerfor the near future.Stockholm, 5th November 2019Magnus NordinManaging DirectorFor further information. please contact:Magnus Nordin.

Full year average production guidance is unchanged, expected at the lower end of the 46,000 to 50,000 boepd guidance range. The 2019 exit production rate expectation remains at 50,000 boepd. Our operating costs per boe for Q3 2019 was USD 13.0, in line with guidance. Full year capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged at USD 188 million.IPC has continued to deliver a robust financial performance during Q3 2019 generating a quarterly operating cash flow of USD 70 million, at the upper end of guidance. This allowed IPC to fund its expenditure program and to reduce net debt from USD 239 million at the end of Q2 2019 to USD 208 million by the end of Q3 2019.In Malaysia, a world class uptime performance on the Bertam FPSO in excess of 99% continued during Q3 2019. Third quarter production on the Bertam field was in line with our Q2 guidance. The three well infill drilling program commenced in late August 2019.In Canada, the N2N enhanced oil recovery project and drilling program in the Suffield area remain on schedule with the N2N plant ramp up ongoing and four out of a planned eight wells on production. The average production from the Onion Lake Thermal facility during Q3 2019 was in line with our Q2 guidance. Facility optimization work has been completed at Onion Lake Thermal that allowed for steam injection to commence at F-Pad during Q3 2019 and for the start-up of production from the F-Pad wells during September 2019.In France, the first horizontal development well at the Vert La Gravelle field commenced production in mid-September 2019. This was IPC’s first horizontal well drilled into the Triassic reservoir in France. Initial indications of productivity from the well are ahead of expectation. We are currently drilling the second well in the Southern part of the Vert La Gravelle field.With significant undrawn credit facilities at our disposal, we continue to opportunistically evaluate additional acquisition targets that we believe can deliver long-term value for our shareholders.Share Repurchase ProgramWe are today pleased to announce that we have sought approval from the TSX to commence a normal course issuer bid to repurchase IPC’s common shares through the facilities of the TSX and Nasdaq Stockholm. The Board of Directors has approved, subject to acceptance by the TSX, the repurchase of up to approximately 11.5 million common shares, representing approximately 7% of IPC's outstanding common shares (or 10% of IPC's ""public float"" as at November 5, 2019), over a period of twelve months. IPC currently does not hold any common shares in treasury.IPC has determined to implement the proposed share repurchase program because it believes that the current common share price does not reflect the underlying value of those shares. IPC believes that the share repurchase program represents an effective use of IPC’s capital and an efficient way to return value to IPC’s shareholders.As and when considered advisable by IPC, common shares may be repurchased on the TSX and Nasdaq Stockholm at the prevailing market price at the time of such purchase and in accordance with the applicable rules and policies of the TSX and Nasdaq Stockholm and applicable Canadian and Swedish securities laws. The actual number of common shares that will be repurchased, and the timing of any such purchases, will be determined by IPC, subject to the limits imposed by the TSX and Nasdaq Stockholm. There cannot be any assurances as to the number of common shares that will ultimately be acquired by IPC. Any common shares purchased by IPC under the share repurchase program will be cancelled.”International Petroleum Corp.

The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, unless otherwise indicated. IPC does not intend, and does not assume any obligation, to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable laws.All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, forecasts, guidance, budgets, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always, using words or phrases such as ""seek"", ""anticipate"", ""plan"", ""continue"", ""estimate"", ""expect"", ""may"", ""will"", ""project"", “forecast”, ""predict"", ""potential"", ""targeting"", ""intend"", ""could"", ""might"", ""should"", ""believe"", ""budget"" and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be ""forward-looking statements"". Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: IPC’s intention and ability to continue to implement strategies to build long-term shareholder value IPC’s intention to review future potential growth opportunities the ability of IPC’s portfolio of assets to provide a solid foundation for organic and inorganic growth the continued facility uptime and reservoir performance in IPC’s areas of operation the completion of the Vert La Gravelle redevelopment project, including drilling and related production rates and the ability to gather further information regarding the southern part of the field, and other organic growth opportunities in France the completion of the third phase of infill drilling in Malaysia and the ability to identify and mature additional locations, and the production uplift from such drilling future development potential of the Suffield operations, including continued and future oil drilling and gas optimization programs, the ability to offset natural declines and the N2N EOR development project (including estimated peak rates and timing of such project) the proposed further conventional oil drilling in Canada, including the ability of such drilling to identify further drilling or development opportunities development of the Blackrod project in Canada the results of the facility optimization program and the work to debottleneck the facilities and injection capability and the F-Pad production, as well as water intake and steam generation issues, at Onion Lake Thermal the intention to commence a share repurchase program, including the acceptance thereof by the TSX the ability to IPC to acquire common shares under the proposed share repurchase program, including the timing of any such purchases the return of value to IPC’s shareholders as a result of the share repurchases program 2019 production range, exit rate, operating costs and capital expenditure estimates potential further acquisition opportunities estimates of reserves estimates of contingent resources estimates of prospective resources the ability to generate free cash flows and use that cash to repay debt and to continue to deleverage and future drilling and other exploration and development activities. Statements relating to ""reserves"" and ""contingent resources"" are also deemed to be forward-looking statements, as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the reserves and resources described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and that the reserves and resources can be profitably produced in the future.  Ultimate recovery of reserves or resources is based on forecasts of future results, estimates of amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management.The forward-looking statements are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by IPC, including expectations and assumptions concerning: prevailing commodity prices and currency exchange rates applicable royalty rates and tax laws interest rates future well production rates and reserve and contingent resource volumes operating costs the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals the performance of existing wells the success obtained in drilling new wells anticipated timing and results of capital expenditures the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out planned activities the timing, location and extent of future drilling operations the successful completion of acquisitions and dispositions the benefits of acquisitions the state of the economy and the exploration and production business in the jurisdictions in which IPC operates and globally the availability and cost of financing, labour and services and the ability to market crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids successfully.Although IPC believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because IPC can give no assurances that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to: the risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general such as operational risks in development, exploration and production delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to reserves, resources, production, revenues, costs and expenses health, safety and environmental risks commodity price and exchange rate fluctuations interest rate fluctuations marketing and transportation loss of markets environmental risks competition incorrect assessment of the value of acquisitions failure to complete or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or dispositions the ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources failure to obtain required regulatory and other approvals and changes in legislation, including but not limited to tax laws, royalties and environmental regulations. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.Additional information on these and other factors that could affect IPC, or its operations or financial results, are included in the MD&A (See ""Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information"" therein), the Corporation's Annual Information Form (AIF) for the year ended December 31, 2018 (See ""Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information"", ""Reserves and Resources Advisory"" and ""Risk Factors"" therein) and other reports on file with applicable securities regulatory authorities, which may be accessed through the SEDAR website (www.sedar.com) or IPC's website (www.international-petroleum.com).Non-IFRS MeasuresReferences are made in this press release to ""operating cash flow"" (OCF), ""Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization"" (EBITDA), ""operating costs"" and ""net debt""/""net cash"", which are not generally accepted accounting measures under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable with definitions of OCF, EBITDA, operating costs and net debt/net cash that may be used by other public companies. Non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.Management believes that OCF, EBITDA, operating costs and net debt/net cash are useful supplemental measures that may assist shareholders and investors in assessing the cash generated by and the financial performance and position of the Corporation. Management also uses non-IFRS measures internally in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, prepare annual operating budgets and assess the Corporation’s ability to meet its future capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Management believes these non-IFRS measures are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they highlight trends in the core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management believes such measures allow for assessment of the Corporation’s operating performance and financial condition on a basis that is more consistent and comparable between reporting periods. The Corporation also believes that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of issuers.The definition and reconciliation of each non-IFRS measure is presented in IPC's MD&A (See ""Non-IFRS Measures"" therein). Disclosure of Oil and Gas InformationThis press release contains references to estimates of gross 2P reserves attributed to the Corporation's oil and gas assets. Gross reserves are the total working interest reserves before the deduction of any royalties and including any royalty interests receivable.Reserves estimates, contingent resource estimates and estimates of future net revenue in respect of IPC’s oil and gas assets in the Suffield area of Canada are effective as of December 31, 2018, and are included in the report prepared by McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd. (McDaniel), an independent qualified reserves evaluator, in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (NI 51-101) and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (the COGE Handbook), and using McDaniel's January 1, 2019 price forecasts.Reserves estimates, contingent resource estimates and estimates of future net revenue in respect of IPC’s oil and gas assets in the Onion Lake, Blackrod and Mooney areas of Canada are effective as of December 31, 2018, and are included in reports prepared by Sproule Associates Limited (Sproule), an independent qualified reserves evaluator, in accordance with NI 51-101 and the COGE Handbook, and using McDaniel's January 1, 2019 price forecasts.Reserve estimates, contingent resource estimates, prospective resource estimates and estimates of future net revenue in respect of IPC’s oil and gas assets in France and Malaysia are effective as of December 31, 2018, and are included in the report prepared by ERC Equipoise Ltd. (ERCE), an independent qualified reserves auditor, in accordance with NI 51-101 and the COGE Handbook, and using McDaniel’s January 1, 2019 price forecasts.The price forecasts used in the reserve reports are available on the website of McDaniel (www.mcdan.com), and are contained in the MCR.""2P reserves"" means IPC’s gross proved plus probable reserves. ""Proved reserves"" are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves. ""Probable reserves"" are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves.Contingent resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development, but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies. Contingencies are conditions that must be satisfied for a portion of contingent resources to be classified as reserves that are: (a) specific to the project being evaluated and (b) expected to be resolved within a reasonable timeframe. Contingencies may include factors such as economic, legal, environmental, political, and regulatory matters, or a lack of markets. It is also appropriate to classify as contingent resources the estimated discovered recoverable quantities associated with a project in the early evaluation stage. Contingent resources are further classified in accordance with the level of certainty associated with the estimates and may be sub-classified based on a project maturity and/or characterized by their economic status.There are three classifications of contingent resources: low estimate, best estimate and high estimate. Best estimate is a classification of estimated resources described in the COGE Handbook as being considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will be actually recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.Contingent resources are further classified based on project maturity. The project maturity subclasses include development pending, development on hold, development unclarified and development not viable. All of the Corporation’s contingent resources are classified as either development on hold or development unclarified. Development on hold is defined as a contingent resource where there is a reasonable chance of development, but there are major non-technical contingencies to be resolved that are usually beyond the control of the operator. Development unclarified is defined as a contingent resource that requires further appraisal to clarify the potential for development and has been assigned a lower chance of development until contingencies can be clearly defined. Chance of development is the probability of a project being commercially viable.References to ""unrisked"" contingent resources volumes means that the reported volumes of contingent resources have not been risked (or adjusted) based on the chance of commerciality of such resources. In accordance with the COGE Handbook for contingent resources, the chance of commerciality is solely based on the chance of development based on all contingencies required for the re-classification of the contingent resources as reserves being resolved. Therefore unrisked reported volumes of contingent resources do not reflect the risking (or adjustment) of such volumes based on the chance of development of such resources.The contingent resources reported in this press release are estimates only. The estimates are based upon a number of factors and assumptions each of which contains estimation error which could result in future revisions of the estimates as more technical and commercial information becomes available. The estimation factors include, but are not limited to, the mapped extent of the oil and gas accumulations, geologic characteristics of the reservoirs, and dynamic reservoir performance. There are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with recovery of such resources, including many factors beyond the Corporation’s control. There is uncertainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the contingent resources referred to in this press release.2P reserves and contingent resources have been aggregated in this press release by IPC. Estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same level of confidence as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties, due to aggregation. This press release contains estimates of the net present value of the future net revenue from IPC's reserves. The estimated values of future net revenue disclosed in this press release do not represent fair market value. There is no assurance that the forecast prices and cost assumptions used in the reserve evaluations will be attained and variances could be material. BOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of 6 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) per 1 barrel (bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.  As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a 6:1 conversion basis may be misleading as an indication of value.CurrencyAll dollar amounts in this press release are expressed in United States dollars, except where otherwise noted.

The focus has been to look beyond the regulatory change andtake decisive actions to reduce future cost and improve operational efficiency.This includes outsourcing of IT infrastructure, site consolidation in France tofurther improve efficiency, initial establishment of a nearshoring centre inRomania, as well as continued live-testing of new payment solutions. The resultsof the third quarter, however, only show the costs and not the benefits of theseinvestments. Adjusting for this, the quarterly performance is on par withprevious quarters.In addition we took a significant step in implementing a post-NPL backstopbusiness model when closing our first securitisation transaction. I am veryproud to have received firm commitment for a second securitisation transaction,this time with an investment grade rating. This represents an importantmilestone showing that we are a flexible and agile company. I also believe thatthe positive feedback that we have received from investors and rating agenciesis a strong underwriting of the Hoist Finance assets, investment procedures,servicing capabilities and our professional and competent teams. Although thesestructures increase our average cost of funding somewhat, we are very confidentthat the banking model still offers the most sustainable and competitive fundingmodel. Our access to low cost funding is simply the best there is in theindustry.The market outlook is positive. There is a strong pipeline across all assetclasses, and margins have developed favourably.

Weare pleased that the previous negative organic growth has now reversed in thethird quarter and shows a slight increase. Adjusted EBITA increased by 10% toSEK 53 million (48) and the adjusted EBITA margin was 3.4% (3.5). Our financialtargets are, in the medium term, to grow by more than 5% annually throughorganic growth and acquisitions with an adjusted EBITA margin of more than 4%.In the Finnish operation, the change process is starting to generate results,organically revenues increased by 6.6% in the quarter. Cabonline has beensuccessful in attracting and recruiting new transporters and drivers. Thetransition from self-owned cars to more transporter-owned cars has gone well -in just over a year we have gone from zero to a situation where one third of thecars in Finland are owned by trans-porters. This is an important change for usand adaptation to our business model, which is characterized by, among otherthings, low capital tied up and great scalability.In Norway, Cabonline's lifestyle brand jip, which was previously only availablein Trondheim, has now been launched in Oslo as well. In Trondheim, the number ofjip journeys continues to increase and now more than 10 000 trips are completed.The new concept has had a strong impact in the media, and we have received asolid support from the Samferdselsdepartementet and Forbrukerrådet.In Denmark, Cabonline has established itself as a player in the entire Danishtaxi market. During the period, Cabonline won the first contract here, whichrefers to service travel for Danpilot (the state part operation) in NorthJutland.In Sweden, Cabonline received renewed confidence in several public tenders inthe regions of West, Örebro and Malmö. The new agreements run from the summer of2020 except in Malmö where our contracts start from October 2019.The shortage of drivers remains one of our biggest largest challenges in allmarkets and we have worked during the period to mobilize support for ourtransporters in their efforts to recruit new drivers.We are also focusing on maintaining and enhancing the quality of our servicesand customer offerings. TaxiKurir and Sverigetaxi are today certified accordingto ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 and Norgestaxi was certified during the period. Thismeans further steps in our efforts to maintain a high and stable level ofquality based on established standards.We are now increasing the pace of our change work. During the summer and earlyautumn, we reviewed the entire Group's operations to identify key areas ofimprovement are. One of these areas concerns IT. There are significantpotentials in upgrading to the next generation IT platform for booking andtraffic management.With an upgraded Group-wide IT platform, we will conduct our operationaloperations more efficiently. This also enables faster and smoother integrationof acquired taxi operations while enhancing the quality of delivery tocustomers. We have therefore started preparing for this change and are planningfor an implementation over the next two years. The restructuring will includeboth investments and restructuring costs. In parallel, we expect positiveeffects on profitability and quality of delivery, while at the same timecreating the conditions for a higher rate of our acquisition driven growth.A strategically important part of our change process is also a new brandstrategy. The project has been initiated, and the ambition is to streamlinecommunication with the customer and contribute to an attractive, uniform andclear image of the company in all markets.The financial statements were finalized earlier than anticipated and thereforethe Board decided to release the interim report at an earlier date.Peter ViinapuuPresident and CEOFor further information, please contact:Peter Viinapuu, CEO, tel +46766411006Johan Ryrberg, acting CFO, tel + 46705387670This information is such that Cabonline Group Holding AB (publ) is obliged todisclose in accordance with the EU’s Market Abuse Regulation.

Organic growth was strong at 10 percent, acquisitionscontributed with 4 percent and the currency translation exchange rate effect was2 percent. At SEK 109 m, EBIT was 27 percent above last year’s profit of SEK 86m, and EBITDA was SEK 137 m compared with SEK 102 m in the corresponding periodthe preceding year.Our Products & Solutions segment reported a sales increase of 17 percent whileInstallation Services increased 11 percent. Sales were driven by strong demandin almost all parts of the business.Veg Tech, which was acquired in the beginning of July 2018, showed strong salesand contributed positively to the organic growth as well as increased profit ofthe Group in the quarter. As weather conditions were fairly favorable during thethird quarter, especially compared with the warm and unusually dry summerprevious year, sales within green infrastructure were strong both in Norway andSweden. In order to secure volumes for coming years, Veg Tech has started localproduction of sedum in Norway and the first deliveries of Norwegian sedum willtake place next year.As communicated earlier, the customer delays in the Taasinge prefabricatedelements business in Denmark have created difficulties in optimizing theproduction planning leading to lower efficiency and earnings. The situation inDenmark has continued to stabilize during the third quarter, while the Norwegianbusiness in RVT experiences challenges in the installation department due tosignificantly increased volumes and building site inefficiency.In July, Taasinge strengthened its position in eco-friendly construction byacquiring a small installation business in Denmark. Taasinge now offers ourcustomers a complete solution, from drawing to assembly at the building site, inorder to ensure that both the logistics and the execution are as high in qualityas possible. Nordic Waterproofing has the ambition to contribute significantlytowards making buildings and infrastructure, as well as the construction processitself, sustainable and climate efficient. We see a strong opportunity forincreasing the use of wood in prefabricated building parts. Wood bindssignificant amounts of carbon dioxode, and its use in building and constructioncontributes to reducing climate change. Using prefabricated building partsreduces construction time considerably compared to on-site building, generatingfinancial benefits and reducing energy consumption.The legacy business within bitumen roofing was strong during the quarter, drivenby flat roofing products in all Nordic countries but also sales of geomembranesin Finland. In Norway we continue to experience strong competition and pricepressure as the consolidation within builders’ merchants is on-going. Ourintensified sales and marketing efforts to increase market share continues buthas yet to produce increased sales volumes and profitability within thebuilder’s merchants segment. The consolidation within builders’ merchants isvisible also in Sweden and we see customer movements between different builders’merchants. On the other hand, the flat roofing market remains stable and westill only see a minor impact from the weaker housing market. In Denmark, theflat roofing market is strong although organic growth has been somewhat slowerthis year. The Finnish builders’ merchants market is somewhat weaker with lowervolumes than in the corresponding period the preceeding year. SealEco and therubber membrane business developed well also in the third quarter, primarilydriven by DistriPond which was acquired earlier this year.Within the Installation Services segment, activity was higher particularly inthe flat roofing business. In general, the outlook and the Finnish marketexpectations are slightly negative, which makes for a continuously competitivemarketplace. However, the order intake during the third quarter was highercompared with previous year with a healthy margin. Our Danish franchisecompanies continue experiencing a strong market and perform well in the thirdquarter, with strong order books and an EBIT contribution above thecorresponding period last year.We see current trends continuing for the rest of the year, and our resultoutlook remains unchanged.Vejen, 31 October 2019Martin Ellis,President and CEOConference callA conference call for investors, analysts and media will be held today, 31October 2019, at 10:00 a.m. CET and can be joined online atwww.nordicwaterproofing.com (https://tv.streamfabriken.com/nordic-waterproofing-q3-2019).

During the first ninemonths of 2019 we made solid progress across the organization with the expansionof our global footprint, advancements in our pipeline and continued engagementswith the healthcare community in transplantation, autoimmune diseases andbeyond.Our top priority is advancing our lead candidate, imlifidase, through marketauthorization to enable kidney transplants for highly sensitized patients. Atthe same time, we continue to develop our proprietary enzyme technology platformin rare autoimmune diseases, where there is a significant unmet medical need.In September, Hansa Biopharma presented positive imlifidase data at the ESOTCongress in Copenhagen, Denmark. The data was based on a pooled analysis ofhighly sensitized kidney transplant patients from four single arm, 6-month, openlabel, Phase 2 trials of imlifidase treatment prior to deceased and living donortransplantation in sensitized patients. The analysis included 46 patients, ofwhich 50% had a cPRA of 100%, 85% were crossmatch positive and 70% were re-transplanted. Following the treatment of imlifidase, the donor specificantibodies (DSA) levels rapidly decreased and all positive crossmatches wereconverted to negative, thus enabling transplantation of all patients. The datawas fully in line with previously reported data on transplantation of highlysensitized patients with imlifidase.In Europe, the regulatory review process for imlifidase is progressing asplanned, following the acceptance of our Marketing Authorization Application endof February. We expect to receive an opinion from the committee for medicalproducts of European Medicines Agency in the first half of 2020.In the U.S., we recently confirmed a follow-up meeting with the FDA. The purposeof the meeting will be to continue the discussion from our December 2018 meetingregarding the path forward for a regulatory filing of imlifidase in kidneytransplantation of highly sensitized patients in the U.S.Talking about the U.S., we welcome the initiative by the current administrationin the United States, who recently issued an executive order to improve the careof people with end stage renal disease (ESRD). Following the executive order,the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) set out three specificgoals for ESRD:1) Reducing the number of Americans developing ESRD by 25 percent by 20302) Having 80 percent of new ESRD patients in 2025 either receiving a transplantor homecare dialysis3) Doubling the number of kidneys available for transplant by 2030In the U.S., approximately 37 million people have chronic kidney disease andmore than 700,000 have ESRD. There are nearly 100,000 Americans waiting toreceive a kidney transplant, and approximately 20% of the money spent ontraditional Medicare in the U.S. are related to kidney disease. If approved,imlifidase may have the potential to help highly sensitized patients getting offdialysis by enabling transplantation.We have also continued advancing our pipeline during the first 9 months of 2019,with the initiation of two Phase 2 studies in Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) andacute Antibody Mediated Rejection (AMR) in kidney transplantation. In AMR, thefirst patient has now been treated with imlifidase. Our Anti-Glomerular BasementMembrane (Anti-GBM) program is also progressing as expected, with 11 patientsenrolled so far and it’s our aim to complete enrollment in this study by year-end.With the continued progress across the organization and significant progress forour lead candidate and pipeline activities, we are well-positioned to become aglobal biopharmaceutical company that brings lifesaving and life alteringtherapies to patients with rare diseases who need them and generate value tosociety at large. I look forward to updating you on our continued progress.”Søren TulstrupPresident and CEO of Hansa BiopharmaThis is information that Hansa Biopharma AB is obliged to make public pursuantto the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

The main target group iscustomers with some form of non-traditional employment, i.e. self-employed ortemporary employees, including project, part-time or replacement workers. Thanksto thorough credit assessments and personal contacts, more loans are approvedfor this customer group, which is often denied by the major banks despite beingfinancially stable. Interest in the offer has been high and new lendingcontinues to grow.At the end of the first quarter, Nordax also began offering mortgage loans inthe Norwegian market through loan brokers, and at the end of the second quartermortgage applications were being accepted through Nordax’s website. Lending inthe third quarter developed strongly in connection with a diversification ofmarketing channels.Equity release mortgagesNew lending has grown strongly during the year. One contributing factor has beenincreased marketing, which has led to greater awareness of SwedishHypotekspension (SHP) as a brand and equity release mortgages as a product. Moreapplicants also became eligible for an equity release mortgage during the yearafter the lending limit was changed and the offer was extended to more of thecountry’s municipalities.Portfolio developmentTotal lending amounted to SEK 23.8 billion (SEK 15.1 billion as of 31 December2018). The acquisition of SHP, expansion of the product offering to includemortgage loans, and strong quarterly performance in the Swedish market were themost important reasons for the strong growth. Excluding the SHP acquisition,lending grew by 23%, partly due to positive currency effects. All geographicalmarkets except Germany grew. In the Swedish market, mortgages, personal loansand equity release mortgages all contributed to the strong trend.Results January-September 2019 (compared to January-September 2018)  · Operating profit amounted to 388 MSEK (375). Increase due to higher netinterest income and lower credit losses.  · Net interest income amounted to 1 093 MSEK (982). Higher net interest incomedue to a growing lending portfolio and acquisition of SHP.  · Operating expenses amounted to -589 MSEK (-393). Increased costs as a resultof investments in growth initiatives to grow and broaden Nordax’s business butalso aquisition costs and other costs related to SHP.  · Credit losses amounted to -168 MSEK (-276), corresponding 1.2 per cent (2.6)of average lending.For more information, please contactPatrick McArthur, CFO, NordaxTel: +46 760 32 69 70E-mail: ir@nordax.seAbout Nordax BankNordax Bank is a leading specialistbank in Northern Europe owned by NordicCapital Fund VIII and Sampo.

Arion banki hf.,2019-10-30 20:19:42,"Arion Bank hf.Interim report (Q1 and Q3)Arion Bank’s Q3 2019 financial resultsNET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IMPROVE SUBSTANTIALLY FROM PREVIOUS YEARArion Bank reported net earnings of ISK 0.8 billion for the third quarter of 2019, compared with ISK 1.1 billion for the same period of 2018. Return on equity was 1.6% for the third quarter of 2019, compared with 2.3% for the same period in 2018.Net earnings from continuing operations amounted to ISK 3,801 million for the third quarter and ISK 8,849 million for the first nine months of 2019, compared with ISK 1,351 million for the third quarter of 2018 and ISK 6,805 million for the first nine months of 2018. Return on equity from continuing operations was approximately 8.5% for the third quarter of 2019, compared with 6.5% for the first nine months of 2019. The subsidiaries Valitor Holding, Stakksberg and TravelCo are classified as assets held for sale.Total assets amounted to ISK 1,213 billion at the end of September 2019, compared with ISK 1,164 billion at the end of 2018. Loans to customers decreased by ISK 21.3 billion, or 3%, which is in line with the Bank’s strategy to focus on returns rather than the growth of the loan book. Total equity amounted to ISK 196 billion, compared with ISK 201 billion at the end of 2018.The Bank’s capital ratio, including net earnings for the third quarter, at the end of September 2019 was 23.6%, compared with 22.0% at the end of 2018. The CET1 ratio, including net earnings for the third quarter, was 21.6% at the end of September 2019, compared with 21.2% at the end of 2018.BENEDIKT GÍSLASON, CEO OF ARION BANK:“There continue to be positive signs in core operations at Arion Bank. Interest income and income from insurance activities have increased between years and return on equity from continuing operations in the third quarter was 8.5%. Despite these positive developments, Arion Bank’s net earnings for the third quarter are below target owing to a number of factors which the Bank has already reported. The key factors are substantial impairments made in respect of companies held for sale, continuing investments in Valitor’s international business and the recognition of expenses due to organizational changes.The Bank remains financially robust and the liquidity ratio is strong. The Bank therefore has various opportunities available to it and we have decided to initiate a share buy-back program amounting to ISK 4.5 billion, which will commence on 31 October, and which is designed to reduce the Bank’s equity. Strong liquidity, both in Icelandic króna and foreign currency, also means that the Bank is ideally placed to service its customers and to consider repurchasing older and more expensive wholesale funding.At the end of the third quarter the Bank announced extensive organizational changes and new focuses in the business. These changes are designed to make the Bank more competitive and to increase return on equity. As a result of the new structure, the total number of employees was reduced by 12% and the number of divisions by two. The Bank’s strategy of offering our customers a diverse range of financial services and being a leading provider of digital financial services remains unchanged. However, there has been a certain shift in focus in terms of financing our corporate clients. Due to high taxes and high capital requirements imposed on financial institutions, it is sometimes cheaper for companies to seek financing from other sources than traditional bank loans. We aim to support these companies by advising them on the best financing options available and developing strong relationships for the future.Arion Bank has made equality in the workplace a major priority and we have had equal pay certification since 2015. Last year Arion Bank became the first bank to be authorized to use the equal pay symbol of the Ministry of Welfare. Since the Bank was listed on the stock markets in Iceland and in Stockholm a growing number of both Swedish and international analysts have assessed sustainability and equality issues at Arion Bank. Recently Allbright in Sweden reviewed gender representation at all listed companies in Stockholm, a total of 333 organizations, and Arion Bank placed 25th. Although we are proud of this result, we are determined to improve on it.We recently launched the latest feature in the Arion app, a service bringing the benefits of open banking to our customers. We designed this solution in partnership with the fintech company Meniga and it enables anyone with the Arion app to see their accounts and cards at Arion Bank, Landsbankinn and Íslandsbanki in one place. The information is then collected and sorted to give the user a unique overview over household income and expenditure. The new open banking feature has been received positively by our customers and anybody can download the Arion app and start using this new service immediately.”WEBCAST FOR MARKET PARTICIPANTSArion Bank will be hosting a meeting / webcast on Thursday 31 October at 8:30 GMT (9:30 CET) where CEO Benedikt Gíslason, CFO Stefán Pétursson, deputy CFO Eggert Teitsson and Head of Investor Relations Theodór Fridbertsson will present the results and answer questions from participants.

Spruce beetle damaged forestsare still influencing the market. High harvesting volumes results in fullutilization of sawmilling capacity with oversupply of timber as a consequence.Prices for beetle damaged raw material in Central Europe is today at levelsclose to harvesting cost and the focus is to clear the forests from damagedtrees. Part of Sweden is also affected by the spruce beetles, especially in thesouth east, where harvesting is mainly focused on damaged forests. We areoptimistic that all activities in Sweden will help to reduce damages and avoidthe same disaster as in Central Europe.Prices have dropped for all products and especially for lower grades. Trading inthe UK has been really challenging with all uncertainties in connection withBrexit. The US market has during the last months recovered and prices are todayhigher than 12 months ago. Part of the sawmilling industry is now loss makingand there are signs that production volumes will reduce. This could help toimprove market conditions.Bergs Timber’s developmentThe margins for our Swedish sawmills have reduced significantly during the thirdquarter. Stocks are on the high side and we have, as earlier announced, decidedto reduce production during the winter.  Prices for raw material are coming downand will during the fourth quarter partly compensate for lower sales prices.Our Estonian sawmill Savi has been closed during October. The remaining Estoniansawmill Sauga will from January 2020 be integrated with our Latvian operationByko-Lat. This will give cost reductions and positive market synergies.Our Latvian sawmill Vika Wood is facing better raw material conditions than ourSwedish mills and margins are at reasonable levels.Byko-Lat, our Latvian further processing company, has despite challenges in theUK been able to keep normal margins. The new house building factory is now readyfor production.Trading conditions for our UK company have been challenging during the lastsixth months. We have restructured the company in order to prepare for expandedvolumes through our own port. This includes new management. We have also decidedto sell our own vessel and go for time chartered vessels. Changes are now cominginto place and we have a strong position to meet the market and develop ourconcept.Fågelfors Hyvleri, which was acquired during this summer, is now fullyintegrated. Production volumes in the new pellet factory are according to planand we expect to reach full capacity of about 100,000 tons per year during 2020.The market for wood pellets remains good.Focus areasBergs Timber is, after recent year’s expansion, in a consolidation period and weare working with several projects to improve margins and performance:  · Start sales on the Swedish market for doors, windows, houses and gardenproducts from our Latvian company Byko-Lat  · Exploit market synergies between our existing companies  · Integrate our Estonian operation with Byko-Lat  · Work out a strategy for our Swedish sawmills in order to have a long termcompetitive cost level  · Increased focus on sustainability  · Company profiling and market communicationThe market for sawn timber will probably remain uncertain and challenging forsome time. Bergs Timber has today six sawmills, planing mills, pelletproduction, doors and windows production, house production, garden products andlogistics. This gives us increased flexibility to handle various marketsituations.Peter NilssonChief Executive OfficerFurther information regarding the interim report can be provided by the CEO,Peter Nilsson, on telephone number +46 70 315 09 27 or CFO, Anders Marklund, on+46 70 284 47 96.The information in this interim report is such that Bergs Timber AB (publ) isobliged to disclose pursuant to the EU's Market Abuse Regulation and the SwedishSecurities Market Act.

Resulting in revenue growth of 1.2 percent compared to last year.The improvement is due to strengthened sales and marketing efforts across the business.The like for like business has reduced cost by 4 percent compared to last year, partly offsetting the increase in cost from acquired businesses, primarily the fine art business.EBITDA in the first 9 month of 2019 is DKK 6,657k compared to DKK 2,804k (excluding the gain from sale of the Fine Art business in 2018). Comparing EBITDA like for like with last year shows an increase of DKK 4.4m. EBITDA in Q3 is below last year mainly due to the negative EBITDA in the Fine Art business in Q3, as Fine Art auctions and the related revenue primarily is placed in Q2 and Q4.The Cash Flow from Operations in Q3 is DKK -18,7m an improvement of DKK 1.5m compared to 2018. For the first 9 months of 2019 the Cash flow from operations improved by DKK 45.7m compared to 2018. The improvement is partly driven by seasonality in the business significantly impacted by timing of Fine Art auctions, and partly due to improved EBITDA.To support and strengthen the positive development we will continue the intensified sales- and marketing initiatives and further increase the focus on operations of the business.Commercial initiativesSeveral commercial initiatives are showing positive effect on the results. Among them, a continued increased focus on sales management, business control and execution both internally in the headquarters and in relation to the individual auction houses.The comprehensive optimization process that all auction houses have gone through in terms of logistics and handling of the auction supply chain, has released resources for intensified sales activities, and the efforts are showing now in Q3.In terms of marketing activities, we are continuously focused on creating local activities including an increase in our outreach via focused social media, which is still showing a positive effect and strengthening our presence in the local and regional communities.To increase the number of new sellers, a national campaign communicated in national publications and social media, was performed spanning 6 weeks in July and August. The purpose of this campaign, First Time is Special, was to invite potential customers who never sold with Lauritz.com before to try selling with us. This had a positive effect and proved the potential among consumers who never sold with us before. Furthermore, we are continuously communicating our standard free pickup-service and personal booking of experts for private home visits.We are still targeting professional sellers to consign larger lot stocks or one-off sales within both vintage items and newly produced items. As to the furniture and decoration market, we are approaching design producers to sell e.g. previous season’s product inventories or suitable surplus items directly on auction. Furthermore, we have introduced a new overall theme, New Nordic, focusing on high-end newly produced luxury items, promoting these curated theme auctions Internationally and on all platforms.With regards to Stockholms Auktionsverk, we have observed a continuously positive steady development in Q3. The implementation of Lauritz.com’s sales management system is expanding the commercial skills among our Swedish experts whose role is currently changing from a more internal role to a more external role, proactively contacting potential sellers for consignments. Moreover, our focused brand related collaborations with other strong brands and ambassadors are are influencing the results positively, and we have strengthened our Stockholm based marketing department to support the positive development further.New CEOOn October 1st Carsten Rysgaard joined the group as CEO.Bengt Sundström, Chairman of the boardCarsten Rysgaard, CEOPreben Vinkler Lindgaard, CFOHighlights 2019July – September 2019  Revenue in line with last year in like for like business.

Revenues are affected by lowermarket prices in all our segments. The trend this quarter remains the same asfor the first half year with decreasing volumes in the Nordics, besides inFinland, stable volumes in the Netherlands and positive volume development inPortugal. In Sweden we have have been working hard during the year with aturnaround as previously communicated. We are now starting to see the resultsfrom those activities in our earnings. In Norway, volumes are affected by lowerslaughter volumes in the factories we supply fish boxes to in 2019 compared tolast year, which can vary from one year to another due to biological reasons.In 2019, an increase in the general market supply of the EPS raw material, hasput pressure on prices, and thus impacted both revenues and profitability in ourRAW segment. On the other hand, lower raw material prices have positivelyimpacted the margins in our downstream segments, Packaging & Components andInsulation. This proves that our integrated business model, from raw material toproduction of end-products, serves as a stabilizing factor for the Group, makingus well positioned to meet various market scenarios.As previously communicated, we have had operational challenges in one productionline of the RAW segment this year. Unfortunately, the challenges are stillaffecting our profitability in this segment, but we expect to have the issuesresolved by early 2020.We are pleased to see that most of our regions are delivering positivecontribution to our margin development both this quarter and for the first ninemonths of this year. Although this can partly be explained by the favourable rawmaterial prices, there are numerous other factors also contributing Themeasures we have implemented to reduce cost and improve efficiency in theSwedish operations are yielding positive results and so is the growth in Finlandand Portugal as well as the synergies achieved from the merger with Synbra.Finally, we are excited to see that our continuous efforts to innovate new andmore sustainable materials and products, as well as our recycling activities areprogressing well. We have said that we will Lead the Change in the EPS industry– and with our recent launch of the world’s first EPS raw material made from 100per cent recycled EPS, we are closing the EPS life-cycle loop. This means thatwe can reduce the usage of virgin fossil raw materials and reduce the waste fromour industry – and at the same time contribute to protecting goods and peoplethrough the superior qualities of our products.Please see the full interim report for the period January – September 2019attached.For further information, please contact:Charlotte Knudsen, Director of IR and Communications, BEWiSynbra Group AB, tel:+479756 1959Marie Danielsson, CFO, BEWiSynbra Group AB, tel: +46 70 661 0047About BEWiSynbra Group ABBEWiSynbra Group is one of the largest vertically integrated producers ofexpandable polystyrene (EPS) in Europe, focusing on sustainable solutions forpackaging and technical components, as well as insulation.

The third quarter of 2019 became SBB's best quarter everin terms of profit from property management which doubled compared to the sameperiod last year. Cash flow from operating activities before changes in workingcapital increased by 99 percent to SEK 507m (255). Adjusted for non-recurringcosts for, among other things, the repayment of expensive loans, cash flow forthe nine-month period lands at SEK 657m (335). On top of delivering the strongcash flow and strong earnings capacity from the property management, we continueto deliver profit from three value-creating areas - renovations/investments inour properties, development of building rights and transactions.Our renovation rate is now at the levels that we have strived for and willcontinue to yield strong earnings and growth in EPRA NAV. In the first ninemonths, we began renovating 476 apartments and for another 232 apartments, theleases of which are cancelled, agreements have been signed for renovations tocommence in the fourth quarter. In the first nine months, transactions totalledapproximately SEK 16 billion. Transactions continue to provide a strong return.Property development also continues to provide a strong return. At 30 September,SBB had development projects in various detailed development planning phasestotalling approximately 1,020,000 sq.m. GFA.We are focussing on achieving a BBB+ rating in the next 12 months, which is aprerequisite for strong growth. Our strong financial position looks evenstronger when we can show that our average interest rate decreased in the past12 months from 2.49 percent to 1.75 percent. Our adjusted earnings capacity endsup at SEK 1,141 million, corresponding to an increase of 48 percent from SEK 770million since the end of 2018.SBB’s secure cash flows are only marginally affected by the economy and externalfactors and as the Nordic region’s leading actor with a focus on socialinfrastructure  we are active in a market where the need for investments insocial infrastructure in the next 10-year period is the highest ever. We delivera strong earning capacity from property management and see good conditions tocontinue delivering further earnings from our three value-creating areas –renovations/investments in the existing portfolio, the development of buildingrights and transactions. For 2019-2021, my assessment is that we will be able todeliver the highest annual increase in EPRA NAV among all Swedish listedproperty companies. SBB’s strong journey of growth is supported by the fact thatSBB’s B- and D-shares have been traded on Nasdaq Stockholm’s Large cap listsince 20 September 2019 and the potential to growth may be even stronger withthe inclusion of SBB’s B-shares in the FTSE EPRA Nareit Global Real EstateIndex, that I expect may already happen in connection with the next quarterlyIndex review that will be published on 5 December 2019.”Ilija BatljanCEO and FounderAttachment: Interim Report January – September 2019The interim report can also be found in the following link:sbbnorden.se/en/investor-relations-main/reports/.For further information, please contact:Ilija Batljan, CEO and Founder of Samhällsbyggnadsbolaget i Norden AB, +46 70518 39 67, ilija@sbbnorden.seThis information is information that Samhällsbyggnadsbolaget i Norden AB (publ)is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

Resurs Holding AB,2019-10-29 07:30:00,"“Continued growth in yet another strong quarter.” Kenneth Nilsson, CEO ResursHolding AB1 July–30 September 2019*  · Lending to the public rose 13% to SEK 31,125 million  · Operating income increased 5% to SEK 925 million  · Operating profit rose 6% to SEK 416 million  · Earnings per share increased 5% to SEK 1.60  · C/I before credit losses (excl. Insurance) was 37.6% (39.2%)  · The credit loss ratio was 2.0% (2.1%)1 January–30 September 2019*  · Lending to the public rose 13% to SEK 31,125 million  · Operating income increased 7% to SEK 2,734 million  · Operating profit increased 8% to SEK 1,198 million  · Earnings per share increased 8% to SEK 4.63  · C/I before credit losses (excl. Insurance) was 38.9% (40.5%)  · The credit loss ratio was 2.1% (2.1%)  · Resurs Holding AB plans to issue Additional Tier 1 instruments of SEK 100-400 million in the next few months, if market conditions are favourable. Thepurpose of such an issue is to further enhance Resurs’s capital structure.Statement by the CEOThe healthy performance of both our banking segments generated continued stronggrowth in lending for the third quarter of the year. It meant that Resurs grewquicker than the market and delivered above our financial targets, with lendinggrowth of 13 per cent, which on 30 September amounted to SEK 31,125 million.Resurs also achieved its best ever earnings for a single quarter with profitafter tax of SEK 320 million (306). This was achieved through our profitablegrowth based on responsible credit lending and continued good cost control. Thecost/income ratio excluding Insurance declined further to 37.6 per cent (39.2per cent) and the credit losses were stable at 2.0 per cent (2.1 per cent).Innovative solutions and number of new collaborations with retail financepartnersThe core of Resurs’s business model, Payment Solutions and mainly retailfinance, continued to report robust growth in the third quarter. A factor forsuccess is our concerted efforts to develop new and innovative solutions for ourretail finance partners. A prime example is the launch of a new and upgradedversion of Resurs’s partner portal – the Merchant Portal – during the quarter.One of the benefits this provides is a service for retailers to quickly andeasily capture all sales statistics in real time regardless of sales channel.Some examples of new collaboration during the quarter is that Svensk Handel(Swedish Trade Federation) has added us as a new partner. Resurs Checkout is nowSvensk Handel’s latest offering to its members for store, e-commerce and omni-retail payment solutions, meaning that Svensk Handel’s members now have greateropportunities to offer their customers a smooth shopping experience withfavourable conditions for both higher average purchases and increased customerloyalty. The ability of Resurs Checkout and the omni-solution to offer aneffective customer journey also meant that a number of major companies in thecar-dealer aftermarket segment decided to sign agreements with us.Major transformation of Norwegian consumer loan marketAll in all, Consumer Loans delivered healthy third-quarter lending growth, butthe business segment continued for face certain challenges. These are mainlyrelated to the far-reaching transformation that the Norwegian market iscurrently undergoing, which is the effect of the new legal requirements thatcame into effect in May combined with the implementation of the Gjeldsregisteretdebt information service at the start of July.For Resurs it is a matter of designing an offering – in pace with the emergingmarket conditions – that meets both the new rules of play, and delivers customerand business value. The fundamental and governing factor for all of ourdecisions is always to prioritise a high credit rating over volume. Ourgeographically diversified business model with its ability to compensate thebusiness segments according to varying market conditions gives us the enduranceand strength required to defend a sustained strong position in the Nordicmarkets in the long term.We also noted a continuous increase in the average loan in Consumer Loans,primarily driven by the option of offering higher loans to our consumers usingthe credit engine. Compared with the year-earlier quarter, the average loan roseto about 15 per cent to app. SEK 100,000. In the shorter term, this results in alower NBI margin. In the longer term, it will however contribute positively toour overall profitability since higher average loans with higher credit qualityentail lower credit risk.A stagnant market and cautious approach in Norway, together with the increasingaverage loan and some price pressure across the segment, had a negative impacton the risk-adjusted NBI margin, which amounted to 9.3 per cent (10.2 per cent)for the quarter.Initiatives to optimise our capital structureTo further optimise Resurs’s capital structure, we are investigating thepossibility of issuing Additional Tier 1 instruments (AT 1 instruments) in thenext few months, if the market conditions are favourable. We also announced inthe third quarter that the method for calculating operational risk had beenchanged, which strengthened our capital ratio by 0.5 of a percentage point inthe third quarter.Overall, these initiatives strengthened Resurs’s capital position and mean thatwe are well-prepared to continue to deliver both growth and profitability basedon responsible credit lending and good cost control.Kenneth NilssonCEO Resurs Holding ABMore information:Peter Rosén, CFO, peter.rosen@resurs.se +46 736 564934Christina Jungvid Ohlsson, IR Officer, christina.jungvidohlsson@resurs.se +46707 816558About Resurs Holding:Resurs Holding (Resurs), which operates through the subsidiaries Resurs Bank andSolid Försäkring, is the leader in retail finance in the Nordic region, offeringpayment solutions, consumer loans and niche insurance products.

Beijer Electronics Group AB,2019-10-28 13:00:00,"Third quarter  · Order intake increased to 405 MSEK (372).  · Net sales rose by 16% to 391 MSEK (338).  · EBIT up by 69% to 29.9 MSEK (17.7).  · Profi t after tax amounted to 18.8 MSEK (11.0).  · Earnings per share were 0.65 SEK (0.38).  · Acquisition of Neratec boosts Westermo.Nine months  · Order intake amounted to 1,150 MSEK (1,141).  · Net sales rose by 10% to 1,143 MSEK (1,036).  · EBIT up by 52% to 81.5 MSEK (53.7).  · Profi t after tax amounted to 52.5 MSEK (31.1).  · Earnings per share were 1.83 SEK (1.08).COMMENTS FROM CEO PER SAMUELSSON“BEIJER GROUP accelerated its expansion in the third quarter, and things aremoving in the right direction. Order intake increased, while sales returned goodgrowth and EBIT improved. The earnings upturn is due to increased sales volumes,a wider gross margin and good cost control otherwise. Cash flow also started tohead in the right direction.We operate on markets where digitalization is in rapid growth across anincreasingly connected world. Thus, our major product development initiativesfocused on regenerating and expanding our product range across the Group’s threebusiness entities, are continuing. These investments in future profitable growthalso generate costs that are being charged to ongoing earnings. Some way into2020, over half of our sales will be from products launched after 2016. Ourorganization has demonstrated very good capacity to transform customer needsinto competitive solutions.The Westermo business entity was the big stand-out in the third quarter,achieving record order intake, sales and earnings for a single quarter. After along phase of capacity expansion, we can now conclude that our supply chain isworking well, with greater delivery capacity and shorter lead-times. Westermo’sgoal-oriented focus on initiatives in network solutions for trains wassupplemented by the acquisition of Swiss company Neratec, which further enhancesWestermo’s customer offering. Meanwhile, product development addressing the newsegments of power distribution and rail infrastructure are continuing.The Beijer Electronics business entity achieved some sales increase and earningsimprovement, mainly because of wider gross margins and good cost control. But aspreviously reported, the pattern from previous quarters is continuing, witheffects from the phase-out of four older product generations, which areimpacting order intake and sales. Prior to year-end, customers placedexceptionally large orders for products being phased out this year. Thisirregularity will persist for several quarters yet but will gradually taper offas transition to the new X2 series continues. In the first nine months of theyear, the new X2 series represented 50% of business entity sales. BeijerElectronics is also launching its new Internet of Things platform under theproprietary brand Acirro+ in the fourth quarter. This platform consists ofsoftware and hardware, which enables secure communication with the cloud for ourcustomers.The Korenix business entity is following the plan set, making positive progressin terms of order intake and sales in the third quarter. Another positive wasits order book, which was 50% larger at the end of the quarter than at the samepoint of 2018. Additionally, Korenix is still maintaining high productdevelopment activity, which will involve the progressive launch of a number ofnew products. This is also causing higher product development costs, which doexert a short-term profitability impact. However, there is potential for Korenixto approach break-even for the full year 2019.Our view is that BEIJER GROUP will still be able to increase sales and earningsfor the full year 2019 compared to 2018.The uncertainty regarding economic conditions in our business environment ispersisting. We’re noting some slowdown from our customers in the UK due toongoing Brexit negotiations. German automation customers are also more cautious,but otherwise, we’re not noting any significant demand slowdown from a cyclicaldownturn. furthermore, we have strong order books, which are significantlylarger for all business entities than for the same period of the previous year.In a longer perspective, and against the background of the initiatives we’reconducting in each business segment, the Group is now well positioned forcontinued healthy and high growth. With increased sales volumes, we’re nowconverging on our margin target of 10%.”INVITATION TO CONFERENCE CALLToday a conference call will be held for press and analysts, where President andCEO Per Samuelsson and EVP and CFO Joakim Laurén present the company and commenton the report.Time: Monday October 28, 14.00 CETTo participate in the conference please dial:From SE: +46850558355From UK: +443333009265To access the presentation please use this link:https://www.anywhereconference.com?Conference=301301199&PIN=15159670&UserAudioMod e=DATAThe report and the presentation will be available at the company’s websitewww.beijergroup.com.

Pricer AB,2019-10-25 13:00:00,"Continued good profitability, tough comparison figures versus 2018Third quarter 2019  · Net sales amounted to SEK 232.5 M (406.0), a decrease of 43 percent comparedto the same period last year.  · Operating profit amounted to SEK 24.8 M (31.0), which corresponds to anoperating margin of 10.7 percent (7.6).  · Order intake was SEK 222 M (286), a decrease of 22 percent compared to thesame period last year.  · Order backlog amounted to SEK 132 M (338), of which the majority is expectedto be invoiced in the next quarter.  · Profit for the period was SEK 27.0 M (27.4). IFRS 16 had a negative impacton profit of SEK -0.4 M.  · Earnings per share (basic) were SEK 0.25 (0.25).  · Cash flow from operating activities was SEK -1.8 M (-52.6).January–September 2019  · Net sales amounted to SEK 765.1 M (808.0), a decrease of 5 percent comparedto the same period last year.  · Operating profit amounted to SEK 76.4 M (60.1), which corresponds to anoperating margin of 10.0 percent (7.4).  · Order intake was SEK 661 M (994), a decrease of 33 percent compared to thesame period last year.  · Profit for the period was SEK 78.6 M (61.5). IFRS 16 had a negative impacton profit of SEK -0.8 M.  · Earnings per share (basic) were SEK 0.71 (0.56).  · Cash flow from operating activities was SEK 26.0 M (24.5).As of January 1, 2019, the company applies IFRS 16 to the Group’s leases. Datafrom previous years has not been restated. The equity/assets ratio decreased by4 percentage points due to an increase in the balance sheet total.Comments from CEO Helena HolmgrenIt was expected that net sales in the third quarter of SEK 233 M would not reachlast year’s record-high sales for a single quarter of SEK 406 M. This is due tothe large U.S. customer project that contributed just over SEK 200 M to the netsales for the corresponding quarter of last year and which was not compensatedby a similar project in 2019. Instead, the good news is that the underlying flowof small and mid-sized customer projects continues to show growth and that thegeographic distribution indicates a widening of the addressable market.Order intake for the third quarter amounted to SEK 222 M, which is a level thatdoes not fully reflect the continued high activity we note in the market. Asidefrom the order totaling just over SEK 60 M from the Italian grocery store Tosanothat was communicated in July, no other large customer projects were finalizedduring the third quarter. The unevenness created by the timing of large customerprojects in terms of both order intake and sales for individual quarters hasbeen mentioned many times before. Our overall picture remains that the marketactivity is high, and that the interest in store digitalization is growingrapidly in many geographical markets.The third quarter was characterized by numerous in-depth customer projects, ofwhich several are approaching final negotiation stage. As customers’ needs forsolutions to streamline critical store processes are added to systemevaluations, the complexity of integration increases, and each procurementprocess becomes more and more resource intensive. Competition in the marketremains fierce. However, we remain convinced that the benefits of our uniquesystem’s functionality, such as speed, reliability, scalability and batterylife, respond better to the challenges facing retailers than any of ourcompetitors’ systems.The improved gross margin for the third quarter contributes to continued goodprofitability. Similar to the previous quarter, the product and contract mixcombined with optimized component sourcing and good delivery planning had apositive impact on the gross margin. The weak Swedish krona also contributedpositively.The turbulence on the global market following the trade negotiations between theUSA and China and the subsequent import duties has, as we have mentioned before,led to a deferment of business decisions. However, this same uncertainty hascontributed positively to our cost development in the supply chain where, due toa globally declining demand in a number of different electronics segments, therehas been a temporary overcapacity of components and transport, among otherthings. As the situation stabilizes, it is our assessment that costs will returnto their previous levels.To summarize, we are confident about the future. Digital store solutions are anatural part of the future of retail. Despite this, the global penetration rateof ESL (Electronic Shelf Label) systems continues to be low, and our primarycompetitor — the paper label — has no chance to keep up with the development.Helena HolmgrenPresident and CEOEvery care has been taken in the translation of this document.

Althoughthe rate of decline in light vehicle production slowed down slightly,uncertainty remains high, market outlook by IHS continues to be revised down andwe do not see a turnaround in LVP in the near term.We continued to outperform light vehicle production, growing organically* about4.6pp more than LVP in the third quarter, driven mainly by strong development inChina and Americas.Our business cycle management actions are taking effect and the adjustedoperating margin* decline year over year was substantially less than in recentquarters, and it improved sequentially. LVP has continued to slide however, andwe now assume 6-7% global LVP decline for 2019, which moderates our outlook toaround 1% for organic sales growth and to around 9% for adjusted operatingmargin.Although I am not pleased with this profit level, we achieved it in the contextof LVP expectations declining by 7-8pp in just 9 months. The cost improvementactions which enabled this performance will continue relentlessly.We reduced our workforce by an additional 800 in the quarter, or by 1,600compared to a year ago, despite growing our sales organically* by 1.2%. Ourprogram to reduce indirect labor costs by 5% is developing as planned and weexpect it to impact our costs meaningfully as of the fourth quarter 2019.In addition to LVP and raw material headwinds, the strike at General Motors inNorth America is also affecting our sales.Being close to our customers supports our short- and long-term businessopportunities and this quarter we announced two new customer collaborations -the North American road safety research lab together with Great Wall Motor andthe next generation passenger airbag in cooperation with Honda. Our order intakeshare remained on a good level in the quarter, supporting a prolonged salesgrowth outperformance.As always, it is of utmost importance to focus on quality and execution tosecure a strong long-term performance for our company.Conference call and webcastAn earnings conference call will be held at 2:00 p.m. CET today, October 25,2019.

Having beenGroup CFO for more than four years, I know the companies well, and together withthe management groups from our various businesses, I will focus sharply onensuring that Moment Group is once more a profitable business.Moment Group’s business is characterised by seasonal operations and for majorparts of the group, the third quarter means a lower level of activity. This yearis no different. Net sales totalled SEK 146 million (170), a reduction of SEK 24million compared to the previous year, which is mostly attributable to theproduction portfolio in the Live Entertainment business area. However, theoperating loss for the quarter is an improvement on previous years and adjustedfor expenses in conjunction with the CEO replacement, totalled SEK -24 million,calculated under current regulations. Taking the above cost into account, andadjusted for the effect of IFRS 16, the loss was SEK -26 million (-31), which isan improvement of SEK 5 million over the previous year. Broken down per businessarea, live entertainment showed an improvement of SEK 10 million  whileImmersive Venues stood for a deterioration of SEK 4 million. Business Area Eventis performing on a par with last the same quarter last year.The quarter began strongly with the summer’s performance at Vallarna’s OutdoorTheatre in Falkenberg, a production that attracted an audience of morethan 53,000 people. We can also characterise September as a good month forpremières both within 2Entertain and our cabaret venues, and the warm receptionby both the public and reviewers bodes well for future quarters. Prepaid ticketrevenues as of the end of September totalled SEK 147 million (87), which is SEK60 million higher than the previous year. The improvement is mainly attributableto 2Entertain’s ticket-based business, but also to our cabaret venues. This is agood indicator of the sales situation even though it is also affected by thesize of the production portfolio.Kungsportshuset continued to burden the income statement during the thirdquarter, but to a lesser extent, and the building is now being prepared for thespecial Wallmans performance during November and December. At the same time, atransition is under way to a more content-based venue centred around theKungsportshuset Eventarena, which will be filled with various types ofentertainment, productions and corporate events.Following a number of years with a major focus on growth and acquisition, areturn to profitability will be the highest priority in the short term. Analysesof revenues and expenses are under way in every business operation aimed atidentifying better business models and more effective ways ahead. At the sametime, the parent company organisation is being driven forward with a radicallyreduced cost burden for the phase the Group is currently in. On the same theme,Group management consists of purely operative capabilities alongside the Head ofIR/PR and the Group CEO, with a clear focus on business and business support.We have now entered the strongest quarter of the year, and our various businessoperations are looking forward to welcoming and taking care of all of the gueststhe quarter will bring!Gothenburg 25 October 2019Josefin Dalumpro tem CEO/Group CEOjosefin.dalum@momentgroup.comMoment Group is one of the leading players within the Scandinavian experienceindustry.

LKAB Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB,2019-10-25 08:00:00,"In the third quarter net sales increased to MSEK 7,751 (6,594) compared with thesame period last year and operating profit strengthened to MSEK 3,135 (2,477).The quarter was characterised by high and stable production, while a slowdown inthe market led to lower delivery volumes and volatile iron ore prices.Sales for the first nine months increased by 28 percent compared with theprevious year and operating profit was boosted to MSEK 9,764 (4,969),representing an increase of 96 percent. The improved earnings are mainly aresult of higher iron ore prices and a stronger dollar exchange rate. Lowersales had an adverse effect, however, and during the quarter earnings were alsonegatively affected by increased costs for urban transformation provisions.Operating cash flow for the first nine months increased to MSEK 6,759 (4,655).The improvement is primarily a result of the increase in earnings and to lowercapital expenditure.Global market remains volatileAt the beginning of the quarter, the spot price for iron ore reached levels ofaround USD 125/tonne. However, the price level fell substantially during Augustand after recovering somewhat, the quarter ended at USD 93/tonne. The averagespot price for iron ore was USD 102/tonne during the quarter, compared with USD67/tonne in the third quarter of 2018. At the same time, quoted pellet premiumsfell significantly during the quarter.“Steelmakers’ margins are being squeezed, and in combination with high iron oreprices this is contributing to a market climate of reduced demand – particularlyfor highly upgraded iron ore products,” says Jan Moström, President and CEO ofLKAB.Production at record levelsThe production during the third quarter amounted to 7.3 (6.8) Mt and deliveriesto 5.5 (6.9) Mt, of which 79 percent consisted of highly upgraded pellets.Production stability remains as one of LKAB’s focus areas. Maximising volumes inthe current production system is essential for future investments for growth.Lower deliveries in the quarter are a result of lower demand for highly upgradediron ore as a result of squeezed margins at steelmakers in combination with highiron ore prices.“It is pleasing to see that our work to achieve more stable production is payingoff. We are reaching record levels for a single quarter and we will continue tofocus on consistent production in order to avoid even small disruptions and toachieve steadier levels over the quarter,” says Jan Moström.Next generation LKABLKAB is conducting extensive development work for future sustainable mining andsteelmaking processes. This work includes increased investment in explorationalongside with initiatives such as SUM, which aims to set a new global standardfor sustainable mining at great depths, and HYBRIT, an initiative for fossil-free steel production that LKAB is running together with SSAB and Vattenfall.At the UN Climate Summit held in New York during the quarter, HYBRIT was notedas one of the most ambitious and most transformative initiatives for dealingwith climate change.Contact: Bo Krogvig, Senior Vice President of Communications and Public Affairsat LKAB, Tel: 46 (0)8 429 34 45.

Naturally much remains to beachieved, but the increased responsibility companies are taking might becritical for being able to reach the Sustainable Development Goals in the 2030Agenda. I believe this increased sense of responsibility is primarily driven bytwo types of stakeholders – employees and customers.As employees, we are increasingly motivated by, and engaged in, changing theworld and making a difference in our work. As customers, we prefer to purchasegoods and services from suppliers who ensure that their operations are long-termsustainable and that they have no negative impact on society or the environment.Now is the time to act. Sustainability is no longer something that companies“have to” work with because it might be profitable in the long term. The waythat employees and customers are acting means that responsibility andsustainable business have become short-term priorities, which is fantastic. Whensomething is short term, the risk appetite and the discipline to implementincrease. The younger generations are clearly the driving forces in thisdevelopment.If your company is responsible, you attract motivated and engaged employees andcreate demand for your offering. There is already abundant evidence thatsustainability is profitable in the short term. Hamburger chains’ sales increasewhen they sell vegetarian hamburgers and place charging stations outside theirrestaurants. Domestic flights are decreasing while rail travel is going up. Morepeople are choosing green electricity. Research shows that motivated and engagedemployees perform better at work. And so on.Responsible and sustainable business is critical for SBAB’s short-term and long-term competitiveness and profitability.Responsibility and transparencyfor better housing and household financesAccording to Swedish Quality Index (Swe Svenskt Kvalitetsindex), SBAB has beentop three the last five years regarding Sweden’s most satisfied residentialmortgage customers as well as Sweden’s most satisfied corporate clients forproperty loans. Important drivers behind this are responsibility andtransparency. Our interaction with customers is clear and simple. Mortgagecustomers do not need to negotiate and everyone in the same category receivesthe same mortgage rate. Our corporate clients appreciate our accessibility andour sustainability efforts.Regulatory compliance and responsible credit granting are at the essence of abank and constitute important focus areas for SBAB. Regulatory compliance andresponsible credit granting leads to reputation and trust – the life blood of abank. Our surveys on reputation place SBAB at the top of the sector. The moneylaundering scandals earlier this year have seriously harmed the reputations ofand trust in the affected banks according to other surveys, which we noted inthe more tangible form of many mortgage customers changing bank and moving theirmortgages to SBAB.Over the year, the competition for residential mortgage customers hasintensified. While responsibility and transparency are important for customers,the mortgage’s effect on the wallet is also highly significant. During the year,we have developed our pricing model and ensured that we are offering competitiveterms. We posted strong growth in new residential mortgage customers during Q3.We are developing our work with regulatory compliance and responsible creditgranting to expand our societal responsibility by promoting more stringentrequirements for construction companies with the objective of reducing taxevasion, money laundering and the use of unreported employment when constructingnew residential properties in Sweden. The problem at construction sites distortscompetition in the new construction market. We have signed a letter of intent toapply more stringent requirements when granting credit with a large number ofconstruction companies, organisations and trade unions. Our next step is tostart discussions with the other banks aimed at aligning all banks behind morestringent credit granting requirements. Together, we believe we really canachieve change.An attractive workplacefor motivation and commitmentBeing motivated by what the company does and being engaged by the manner inwhich we ourselves contribute is of course what we all desire. In this scenario,we all thrive, feel good, perform well and have fun at work. SBAB’s mission iscritical to our motivation and SBAB’s values-driven work approach is essentialto our commitment. The majority of our newly recruited employees say that ourvalues and our corporate culture were key to their decisions to start workingfor SBAB. In our employee surveys, we ensure that we are primarily motivated byour responsibility and our mission – to contribute to better housing andhousehold finances — and are committed first and foremost to our values-drivenwork approach.Respect, equality and inclusion are at the core of our corporate culture. Ourdifferences enrich us and create the best commercial solutions in terms ofhigher revenue and lower expenses. A few weeks ago, we accepted Samhall’s VisaVägen (“Showing the Way”) prize for the best employer in theVärmland/Örebro/Dalarna/Dalsland regions based on our approach to inclusion. Iwould like to take the opportunity to recommend that you test respekttrappan.se,our tool for a more inclusive workplace.Previously this year, SBAB was ranked fourth in Sweden and twentieth in Europeas the best workplace among large organisations according to Great Place toWork. We take the pulse at our workplace at the end of each quarter. Our latestreading showed that record numbers, 87% of us, considered SBAB an extremely goodplace to work.Sound financesfor trust and long-term footingOur operating profit for the first nine months of the year was SEK 1,768million, our highest to date. Following a challenging first quarter, lendinggrowth has been healthy. At the end of Q3, our total lending amounted to SEK378.2 billion, up 5.7% year-on-year. Our total deposits rose 7.9% to SEK 130.0billion over the same period.We continue to invest in long-term competitiveness and our expenses rose 14.4%compared with the corresponding nine-month period last year, mainly driven byinvestments in a new banking system, digitalisation and the customer offering.We continue to be the most cost-efficient bank with a C/I ratio of 32.5%.Climate change is affecting the housing and property market. Sea levels arerising and shifts in the weather are becoming more violent and more frequent.Moreover, landmasses in the south of Sweden are sinking and landmasses in thenorth are rising. We have conducted initial analyses and climate stress tests,which have shown that relatively few customers in the foreseeable future will beaffected and that the impact on SBAB’s operations are therefore deemed to berelatively limited. But it is important that we act responsibly and inform ourcustomers of the risks posed by climate change when we have completed ouranalyses.Everything is interconnected. When we are motivated and committed, we performbetter and create a competitive, responsible and transparent customer experiencethat results in satisfied customers and growth. Growth and responsibly driven,cost-efficient operations create profitability, which is a prerequisite for ourstakeholders’ trust, for investments and for future competitiveness. It is inthis advantageous position we find ourselves today.Finally, I would like to thank all my 680 fantastic colleagues for anothersuccessful quarter.Klas DanielssonCEO of SBABFor further information, please contact:Klas Danielsson, CEO SBABTelephone: +46 8-614 43 01, email: klas.danielsson@sbab.seMikael Inglander, CFO SBABTelephone: +46 8-614 43 28, email: mikael.inglander@sbab.seSBAB’s business idea is to apply innovation and consideration to offer loans andsavings products to private individuals, tenant owner associations and propertycompanies in Sweden.

We saw a strong organic order growth of 11% in service.As expected, the order intake for equipment was lower than in Q2. Equipmentorders from infrastructure customers were particularly soft. Our miningcustomers are cautious and investment decisions are being postponed.In the near-term, we expect that the demand will remain largely at the levelseen in the third quarter. That said, the economic environment continues to beuncertain.Improved underlying margin and cash flowRevenues in­creased year-on-year with 5% to MSEK 10 158 with an organic declineof 3%.

In addition, we decided to restructure our manufacturing ofhandheld rock drilling tools in China and the majority of the restructuringcosts in Tools & Attachments are related to this.The work-related injuries continued to decrease in the quarter and we continueto strengthen our work in this area. The safety awareness initiative launchedlast quarter is being rolled out globally.Significant interest for automation and information management, and for battery-electric vehiclesIt’s exciting to see that the launch of our 6[th] Sense automation andinformation management solutions received significant attention from the marketand that we received multiple orders. In Chile, we also won a large miningequipment service contract. The contract includes the opportunity in the nearfuture to implement automation features for the customer’s equipment fleet.

The current termsand conditions make it challenging to attract customers into the system and canlead to worsening channelisation. This, in combination with a lower than usualsportsbook margin in September,  resulted in significantly lower Gross winningsrevenue and a GBP 12.8 million decline in EBITDA contribution from Swedencompared to the third quarter in 2018. We also continue to experience headwindsin the Netherlands due to the removal of the iDeal payment solution.”“Outside of Sweden and the Netherlands, we continued to see strong growth inseveral other markets, including the UK and France. Locally licensed revenuegrowth was particularly strong with 33 per cent growth, or 13 per cent growthexcluding Sweden, compared to the same period last year. As expected, thisresulted in margin pressure from higher betting duties which increased with 26per cent compared to the same quarter last year. However, this focus will drivemore sustainable future profit growth. Locally licensed markets were 57 per centof overall Gross winnings revenue in the quarter.”“During the quarter, we launched the Sportsbook product in New Jersey and theUnibet Sportsbook Lounge in Pennsylvania, with the online products to go live inNovember.

Organic net sales increased 5.9% and the adjusted EBITA marginrose 2.6 percentage points to 12.8%. All business areas reported higher margins.Earnings per share increased 150% to SEK 3.53.All business areas demonstrated healthy growth due to implemented priceincreases, a better mix and higher volumes. Growth was strengthened byinnovations and investments in sales and marketing activities.Our online sales continued to perform favorably and totaled approximately SEK9bn for the first nine months of 2019, corresponding to about 10% of total Groupnet sales.We continued our successful innovation work to increase customer and consumervalue and reduce the environmental footprint. During the quarter, ProfessionalHygiene launched Tork Xpressnap® Electronic Drive Thru Napkin Dispenser,including such benefits as increased efficiency for our customers. InIncontinence Products, we launched TENA ProSkin[TM] Protective Underwear, withdifferent models for men and women.

Ongoing cost savings inaddition to this program amounted to SEK 92m. The lower rate was due totemporarily higher production and distribution costs, mainly attributable todisruptions in connection with the start-up of new production capacity, and ahigher pace of product launches, combined with higher demand.

Organizational changes areprocesses, which requires time for both preparation and implementation. It isalso essential to continuously evaluate efforts in order to further develop theorganization and the work ahead. The third quarter is therefore a clear firstindication on where we stand.There is no doubt that we have taken large steps towards the main goal for theorganizational change to further deliver on our promise to always put thetenant first and at the same time offer our employees opportunities for goodprofessional development. I am convinced that improvement must be immediatelyvisible, both internally among our employees, but also for our tenants. Thiscreates motivation for the employees and increased tenant satisfaction.The new property management organization’s work processes and routines haveprovided immediate and noticeable results. During September we launched a newcentral phone number to our customer service for all our communities. Thanks tothis, we have increased our availability and the hours that tenants can get incontact with us. On a weekly basis, we receive approximately 5,000 calls to thenew service center number, and we have the capacity to provide our tenantsservice in 13 different languages. This has not only increased our availabilityand service level but has also simplified the process for tenants to reach us.New ways of conducting maintenance rounds of our properties and communities havetaken us big steps towards being able to offer our tenants even better livingenvironments, as evidenced by the feedback from tenants in many of ourcommunities. We have also gained a new and strengthened leadership within propertymanagement with functional heads and group managers, who are responsible for theoperations going forward. This has created new career paths within the companyand provides opportunities to retain talented and highly motivated employees.Refurbishment campaignsCommunicating the benefits of being a tenant with us to our existing tenants areimportant. We have an attractive offering that lets our tenants choose if theywould like a more modern standard in their living. The interest for thatoffering is large. During the summer months we performed a targeted campaign totenants living in unrefurbished apartments in a few selected communities. Thepurpose of the campaign was to market the possibility to get the tenants’current apartment refurbished, but also to conduct a pilot on a new workingmethod. The campaign became a big success and the method to market our offeringsthis way will be implemented in the entire portfolio and be further developed.Community development and tenant dialoguesWith a large number of ongoing development projects in our communities a numberof tenant dialogues have been conducted during the quarter to listen to thetenants’ views on how the communities should be developed. The tenant dialoguesare important forums where the tenants are given the opportunity to influencetheir own living environments outside their apartments.  A positive andencouraging conclusion from all the dialogues we have conducted during thequarter is that the vast majority of all our tenants feel very at ease in theircommunities. Refurbishment and upgrading efforts have a positive impact on thetenants’ views of the area and their willingness to continue living there. Thiscomes as no surprise, but it is a clear acknowledgement that our businessefforts create value not only for us as a company but also for our tenants, thespecific communities and the community at large.We have also intensified the work on the development of our commercialfacilities within the property portfolio during the quarter. I am convinced thata central part of a pleasant community is that local services and publicservices are close by. This is also something that has been highlighted in ourtenant dialogues. In one of the tenant dialogues we conducted in our portfolioon Albyberget in Botkyrka municipality it became clear that, for instance, thedemand of different types of commercial services is large. As digitizationcontinues more and more purchases are made online and the demand for parceldelivery service points for goods purchased online is large among our tenants.As property owners we have the opportunity to influence this development andwithin this area there is a large potential for business development. Thecommercial- and community development work that have been intensified duringthis quarter will continue in the same pace when we now enter the fourth andlast quarter of the year.New joint venture projectsWe are working with three main objectives to create socially sustainablecommunities. It is about strengthening the sense of community, increase thetenants’ influence and enable improved networks and relationships between peoplewho live and stay in the communities. The most important focus area is perhapsthe cooperation with other parties to reach these objectives. If we cancooperate with other parties with a similar approach we will have a largeimpact. That is why we entered a new cooperation with Haninge municipality andthe organization A Healthy Generation during the third quarter of the year. Thecooperation is an ambitious and long-term project to improve public health.Through the project we will contribute to offering families with children in ourcommunities the possibility to participate in activities for a year free ofcharge. This will give more families the opportunity to an active leisure,better health and increased quality of life.During the third quarter, we have initiated a cooperation with EskilstunaUnited’s women’s football club in a project targeting young girls living in Årbyin Eskilstuna. Within the framework of the concept Ronjabollen, football is usedas a tool to engage and strengthen young girls with limited experience from suchactivities. In this proven working method the participants are introduced toworking with values on among other things health, self esteem and love inparallel to the football activities. Ronjabollen was developed in Gottsunda inUppsala where the initiative has delivered good results. Through this, we arecontributing to making Årby an even more safe and pleasant community.Changes in ownership structureDuring September it was announced that the German residential real estatecompany Vonovia had agreed to acquire the current majority owner BlackstoneGroup’s shares in Hembla. The acquisition is subject to approval by competitionauthorities, which is expected to happen during October or November. Theacquisition will also trigger a mandatory bid on all remaining shares, which isalso expected during the fourth quarter.It has been a great privilege to lead this company during the years withBlackstone as majority owner. The competence and experience they havecontributed with in Hembla’s development have been invaluable. We had not beenwhere we are today, without them. We have focused our strategy towards creatingvibrant communities where the tenants are in focus. Blackstone has throughHembla’s chairman of the board James Seppala and the rest of the board ofdirectors been a leading force in formulating this vision. All of us in thecompany have been given resources and the mandate to realize this vision.Therefore, I want to thank Blackstone and their team for these amazing years.I would also like to welcome Vonovia as new majority owner. Vonovia is a companywith a strategy that is similar to Hembla’s for the most part. I have visitedVonovia’s operations in Germany myself for a couple of years ago and I wasimpressed with their focus on service, the tenants and their ambition to developtheir communities to pleasant living environments. I look forward to continuingworking together with Vonovia in the coming quarter to continue along this pathtogether.Stockholm 25 October 2019Svein Erik LillelandCEO HemblaThis constitutes information that Hembla AB is legally obliged to publish underthe EU’s Market Abuse Regulation.

Our strategic decisionto adapt the organization with a focus on cost awareness and implementimprovements in production has had a direct impact on earnings, which increasedfrom SEK 12 million to SEK 14 million. During the period we noted a tendencyamong customers to reduce their inventories, which meant that growth wasslightly lower.

We have continued to develop proprietary products witha strong focus on digital denistry. As planned, we have continued to registerproprietary dental products for the US market.The decline in sales in Life Science during the quarter was due to the phasing-out of Bruel&Kjaer.

The marginal reduction innet sales of 0.6% and the higher order intake indicate that deliveries of thealready contracted business have now begun. Market development and balancing ofinventory levels have resulted in a continued low production rate. The under-absorption had a negative impact on earnings of approximately SEK 18 millionduring the quarter. Customers’ volume reductions at short notice have counteredthe impact of inventory reduction measures to some extent.Order bookings increased by 7.3% during the quarter. However, the uncertaintyabout the economic situation and the outcome of Brexit make the development inthe coming months difficult to predict. This could also affect the productionrate for the fourth quarter, and ongoing adaptations are being made in bothpurchasing and production.Restructuring in the company’s unit in Bergkamen, Germany began during thequarter, and negotiations are ongoing. Costs for this burdenedQ3 earnings by SEK 20 million. The restructuring is expected to bring annualsavings of approximately SEK 25 million from the 2020 calendar year.The relocation of operations in China, from Beijing to Tianjin, is proceedingaccording to plan and will be completed during the fourth quarter. Relocatingproduction impacted operating earnings for the third quarter with a cost of SEK7 million.

Although PD-1 inhibitors have revolutionized cancer treatment, insome patients, who initially respond to this therapy, the disease will progressand are thus in need of an effective second-line approach. We hope that BI-1206will have the ability to address an important mechanism of resistance to PD1inhibition, and thus may present a powerful next line treatment.We are progressing BI-1206 through multiple clinical trials and continue todevelop other candidates in our pre-clinical portfolio. Current data for BI-1206in hematological cancer is encouraging as a potential first-in-class therapeuticwith a unique mechanism of action.BioInvent has a clear advantage in our in-house production facility.

As asecondary benefit, we contract production for third parties, which generatesrevenues for the company.On October 23 we announced a production agreement with Cancer Research UK, theworld’s largest independent funder of cancer research. Under the agreementBioInvent will produce anti-HER3 antibodies for Hummingbird Bioscience. Theagreement is expected to generate revenue of SEK 30 million.Our proprietary F.I.R.S.T™ platform is the foundation of our pipeline, enablingus to simultaneously identify targets and high-quality antibodies that bind tothem. This unique technology generates potentially promising new drug candidateswhich broaden our pipeline and create licensing and partnering opportunities,with accompanying near-term revenue. A good example is that Pfizer selected thefirst target under our collaboration last July, resulting a payment to BioInventof USD 0.3 million.Martin WelschofCEOContactAny questions regarding this report will be answered by Martin Welschof, CEO,+46 (0)46 286 85 50, martin.welschof@bioinvent.com.

Excluding acquisition costs, operating profit perkilo improved by 8 percent to SEK 1.00 (0.93).  · Net result amounted to SEK 398 million (359), an improvement of 11 percent.  · Earnings per share increased by 10 percent, to SEK 1.53 (1.39).  · Cash flow from operating activities amounted to SEK 130 million (524).  · Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), R12M, was 15.1 percent (15.8 at December31, 2018).Business areas  · Food Ingredients – operating profit improved by 13 percent to SEK 364million (321).  · Chocolate & Confectionery Fats – operating profit reached SEK 206 million(206).  · Technical Products & Feed – operating profit reached SEK 33 million (37), adecrease of 11 percent compared to the very strong corresponding quarter lastyear.CEO’s commentsOur profit growth continued in the third quarter but at a slower pace thanduring the first half of the year. We continue to improve our margin andoperating profit per kilo. Adjusted for acquisition costs, we reached a level ofSEK 1.00 in the third quarter, a milestone for AAK. Food Ingredients was themain driver with a strong year-over-year profitability improvement.Organic volume growth was 1 percent (4) with both Food Ingredients and Chocolate& Confectionery Fats reporting modest volume growth.Operating profit, adjusted for acquisition costs, amounted to SEK 569 million,an improvement of 8 percent compared to last year and an all-time high operatingprofit for a third quarter. Earnings per share increased by 10 percent.Food Ingredients continued its strong trend with an improved operating profit of13 percent. Dairy and Bakery led the way and Foodservice also reported a goodcontribution. The performance of Special Nutrition was mixed. High-end solutionscontinued to grow, although at a slower pace, while we experienced lower volumesfor our semi-speciality solutions. We have an impact from lower birth rates inChina as well as from destocking by some customers.Chocolate & Confectionery Fats had a challenging quarter with limited volumegrowth. There has been an increased pressure from customers to roll existingcontracts forward. We have also, as previously communicated, used more of ourlow-yielding shea kernels which has increased production costs. The last batchesare expected to be used during the fourth quarter. Our investment projects toincrease capacity and strengthen our supply chain are progressing according toplan and are expected to be completed by year-end. Sourcing of new kernels inWest Africa has started very positively. With new kernels in place andadditional capacity, we expect to reach normal cost levels within the businessarea by the middle of the first quarter next year.As for Technical Products & Feed, both our fatty acids business and our feedbusiness declined compared to the very strong corresponding quarter last year.We have lifted profitability to a new level. While the corresponding quarterlast year was a new record, this quarter was still at a good level compared toearlier years.The launch of AkoPlanet™, our portfolio with tailor-made solutions for foodmanufacturers developing plant-based alternatives, has generated strong volumeand profit growth, although from a small base. Our pipeline of customer co-development projects has more than doubled between the second and the thirdquarter.During the quarter we have acquired 80 percent of Soya International (Europe)Ltd. The UK-based company focuses on the sourcing, processing and distributionof non-GMO semi-speciality and speciality lecithins – key ingredients for manycustomers within our core segments. We have also acquired an additional 5percent of the shares of AAK Kamani, the joint venture in India between AAK andKamani Oil Industries Pvt Ltd. AAK now holds 69 percent of the shares.We are well positioned with our offer of plant-based, healthy, high value-addingoils and fats solutions, using our customer co-development approach.

These results, along with our solid cash position,provide the necessary headroom to advance our promising pipeline of opioidfocused products, whilst also embracing the trend towards the adoption ofcomplementary digital therapeutics.All-Time-High financial performance – EBITDA reached SEK 114 millionFollowing a very strong second quarter, I am pleased to report another periodmarked by strong financial results. Also when excluding the Abstral® royalty weshow strong numbers, as EBITDA ex Abstral amounted to SEK 71.7 million (-8,9).This is driven by increased sales of Zubsolv in market segments with belowaverage rebates. The results also reflect improved efficiency measuresintroduced at Orexo and some adjustment of lower returns and rebates relating toprior periods. The financial result has been achieved against some short-termheadwinds with three payers removing exclusivity for Zubsolv and expandingreimbursement to include other products. For Zubsolv, the immediate impact iscompetition in the previously exclusive contracts, WellCare, Humana and UnitedHealth Group. Longer term, Zubsolv will benefit from more payers opening up forreimbursement of Zubsolv with lower rebates. I am encouraged to see continueddouble digit growth for Zubsolv in the plans not impacted by changes in marketaccess and where the rebates are lower than the exclusive contracts.Market Dynamics – increased funding of treatment will improve the business caseA topic that has attracted media attention is the ongoing lawsuits ofmanufacturers of opioid pain medication. Orexo is not implicated in any of thesecases, but some of the damages from these lawsuits is expected to be used toimprove the treatment for opioid addiction. In many states, patient advocacygroups have lobbied for universal access for all treatment options. This hasresulted in legislative changes in some states to force publicly financed payersto reimburse all products, including Zubsolv. The increased funding of treatmentwill also encourage the introduction of new treatment options, which bodes wellfor Orexo’s pipeline of opioid treatments, including our recent foray intodigital therapeutics - increasingly seen as critical to successfully treatingopioid addiction.Digital Therapies – an exciting, growing market set to improve patient outcomesThe use of digital therapeutics is increasing with digital poised to play a keyrole in most, if not all, future interactions with health care providers. Basedon our existing infrastructure and our knowledge of the addiction market, Orexois well positioned to become a leader in bringing new digital treatmentsolutions to the market. Our strategy is to focus on solutions withscientifically proven therapeutic effect which will benefit the healthcaresystem as a whole and more importantly patients. Our partnership with GAIA,announced in August, is a good example of this strategy in action. GAIA hascollated evidence from more than 10,000 patients that supports the use of theirdigital Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in depression and alcohol addiction toimprove treatment outcomes. While leveraging the synergies from our existinginfrastructure in the US our strategy is to continue with our considered buy andbuild strategy and complement our existing offering with new digitaltherapeutics to bring comprehensive and effective treatment solutions to improvepatient outcomes.Summary and Outlook2019 is on track to deliver a very strong financial result enabling the companyto execute on the overarching strategy to expand the commercial platform. Ournext near term milestones will be the results from our ongoing OX338 study andpossibly new business development agreements. Building on the financial successof Zubsolv, we have the resources to both continue broadening our pipeline andproduct portfolio and to build a presence in the increasingly important andcomplementary digital therapeutics market.Uppsala, Sweden, October 24, 2019Nikolaj SørensenPresident and CEOFor further information, please contactNikolaj Sørensen, CEO and President, Joseph DeFeo, EVP and CFO or Lena Wange, IR& Communications Manager Tel: +46 18 780 88 00, +1 855 982 7658 Email:ir@orexo.comPresentationAt 2.00 pm CET, the same day as the announcement of the report, Orexo invitesanalysts, investors and media to attend an audiocast with a web presentationwhere Nikolaj Sørensen, CEO, and Joseph DeFeo, CFO, will present the report.After the presentation a Q&A will be held.

We are very proud of this but even morepleased that we have simultaneously managed to increase our net sales every yearduring the same time. We are passing an important milestone this quarter, as wehave more than MSEK 5 000 in net sales over the past 12 months. To highlight our25-year celebration, we have written an article that can be read later in thereport.We had large extraordinary costs in the third quarter last year, so ourcomparative figures on profit after financial items (EBT) are very strong. It'sgood to be back to more normal levels when it comes to earnings per share. It isworth noting that our EBT margin of 6.6% is somewhat affected by the vacationperiod.MarketAQ Group is growing 9.6% in the quarter, mainly due to the acquisition ofTrafotek, which we completed in June. However, the picture of our businessvolumes is mixed, and we don’t have organic growth during the quarter. Like manyother companies, we feel a slowdown in the investment-heavy segments, such asconstruction and agricultural machines. On the other hand, the development forour less cyclical customers in rail, bus, medical technology, environmentaltechnology and electrification is still good.As a contract manufacturer, we must be able to adjust operations both whendemand increases and when it decreases. We currently have many examples whereour talented subsidiary managers and their management teams work with this. Weincrease capacity where needed and adapt the costume to customer forecasts whereit goes down. At the same time, we are intensifying our sales work and we workeven more diligently to win new business. The contract manufacturer market isfragmented, and we have small market shares, so there are many opportunities tocompensate a decline in some markets with new business. Good examples of thisare, for example, plastic and sheet metal parts for car safety equipment inChina, stainless steel products for healthcare and plastic components for newcustomers who manufacture hand tools.CashflowLower organic growth means that working capital is more stable and we generategood cash flow from operating activities during the quarter. This reduces ournet debt and gives us better opportunities to make acquisitions and invest inthe business. We continue our efforts to recover overdue accounts receivable andoptimize our inventory management.Delivery capabilityOur delivery precision is improving and is now at much better levels for thewhole group than it was a year ago. However, we are still not satisfied and wantto continuously develop our processes and standards to become even more robustand flexible during this and the coming years.OrganisationAQ Group has a strong company culture with core values that are for real incustomer focus, entrepreneurship, simplicity, cost efficiency, courage andrespect. We run our business in decentralized companies with talented leadersand employees who work close to their customers and have a mandate to run thebusiness. In this way, we can be quick and utilize all the opportunitiesavailable in the market. This is a strategy we will continue with. In addition,we are now also working to strengthen our business areas with common expertisein purchasing, processes and sales. Our ambition is to increase the intensity ofour sales work and to identify more opportunities for cost savings in bothpurchasing and manufacturing.When it comes to purchasing, we now see that more opportunities open up after afew years of strong boom. It is important to work hard to realize theseimprovements. AQ also works extensively with productivity in all factories, notleast in Eastern Europe where there are opportunities in e.g. automation androbotization.OutlookOur goal is to be a long-term stable, growing and profitable group with anoperating margin (EBT) of 8% and a strong financial position. We like to dobusiness with the customer in focus. Our employees and managers are doing a goodjob and it will be reflected in new business also in the future.With strong relationships with world-leading customers and committed employees,we will work hard to achieve a stable profit level, accomplish new acquisitions,continue organic growth and generate good cash flow.

Mycronic AB,2019-10-24 08:00:00,Interim Report January–September 2019
Attendo AB,2019-10-24 08:00:00,"Attendo shows good growth but continued pressure on margins in the third quarterof 2019. The quarter was marked by a more stable cost development and increasednew sales. In Finland, a number of measures have been taken to strengthen theoperations long-term, increase satisfaction and restore profitability. Duringthe quarter, Attendo has agreed on a new long-term loan financing with moreflexible terms.President and CEO Martin Tivéus comments on the report“Attendo delivers good growth and stable results, given challenging conditions.We have initiated the turn-around programme in Finland, costs have stabilised,sales of net new beds improved slightly and we have reached an agreement with agroup of banks regarding a new long-term credit facility. However, profitabilityin Finland remains very low and we are taking several actions to strengthen thebusiness for the long term, improve occupancy and increase satisfaction amongcustomers and local authorities.Net sales increased by 8 percent during the third quarter to SEK 3,013m. Organicgrowth from care homes in own operations remains positive, while we are seeing adecline elsewhere, primarily in outsourcing. EBITA excluding capital gains fromthe sale of real estate amounted to SEK 263m, about 30 percent lower than in thepreceding year. Costs have increased structurally in 2019 as a consequence ofhigher staffing requirements in Finland and, at the same time, the strongexpansion of recent years has led to more empty beds in our Finnish operations.We opened a total of more than 400 new beds in own operations during the quarterand the total number of beds at the end of the quarter was around 16,500. Wehave sharply reduced the establishment pace in Finland, but given the long leadtimes in already ongoing projects, the opening pace is expected to remain highuntil the middle of next year. We estimate approximately 1,800 openings in 2019and about 1,600 openings in 2020. The net increase in total beds will not be ashigh, however, because we are discontinuing certain units that have not beenassessed as attractive in the long term. We are also carrying out a gradualshift towards more openings in Scandinavia and fewer in Finland. Averageoccupancy is currently 80 percent, while mature units are demonstratingoccupancy of around 90 percent.During the quarter, Attendo renegotiated its financing and we have agreed withthree banks of a new long-term credit facility. In accordance with theagreement, Attendo will undertake customary financial commitments, includingthat Attendo must fulfil certain covenants. These covenants are more flexiblecompared to the present agreement. Other terms are similar to the previousagreement.Attendo Scandinavia - focus on growth and quality of careOur Scandinavian operations demonstrated continued stable development. Profitsexcluding capital gains were marginally lower than profits in the comparisonquarter. Sales and occupancy for own care homes improved slightly and home careoperations are continuing to show positive development. Likewise, revenues andprofits stabilised in outsourcing, although at a low level. Attendo won newoutsourcing contracts of SEK 45m in annual income during the quarter. We arecontinuing to identify new opportunities to open nursing homes in own operationsin Scandinavia and construction of one new nursing home began during thequarter. An active effort is in progress to continue developing Attendo’squality position in Scandinavia through improved methods, new digital tools andthe roll-out of an enhanced culinary concept.Attendo Finland - some signs of stabilisationIn the aftermath of the turbulence in the Finnish care market, Attendo Finlandreported very weak financial performance in relation to the comparison quarterin the preceding year. This was caused by higher staffing costs due to higherstaffing requirements, a large number of units in the start-up phase, a low paceof net sold beds and weak development in the acquired business Mikeva. Somestabilisation has occurred in relation to the second quarter of 2019. Inaddition to positive seasonal effects, costs have stabilised and sales of newbeds have increased somewhat. The opportunity to recruit new employees hasimproved, although we expect this to be a limiting factor in being able to takein new customers in future quarters as well.The government also announced a proposal in the third quarter to furtherincrease the staff ratio in certain parts of care for older people by 2023. Itis too early to assess the impact of this proposal as all details have not yetbeen clarified.As previously communicated, our strong measures to reverse the trend in Finlandare continuing:  · We have strengthened the management with a new business area director, VirpiHolmqvist and a new Finance Director, Henna Plit.  · We carried out a reorganisation in the third quarter, in which we increasedthe number of regional / area managers to improve the operations.  · We have reinforced our central and regional recruitment support functionsand are stepping up the recruitment of Filipino nurses to Finland.  · As our contracts in Finland expire, we are seeking compensation for thehigher demands in negotiations with the contracting local authorities.  · To increase occupancy more quickly, we sharply reduce the number of newestablishment projects and we close down units where the opportunities to fillbeds are considered unsatisfactory.  · We have an ongoing action programme aimed at further improving quality,employee commitment and customer satisfaction in Finland.Highest customer satisfaction will lead to long-term successWe have a long journey ahead to re-establish trust and profitability in ourFinnish operations. But we can already see that our actions are effective andfinancial performance is starting to stabilize in the third quarter. We have hadthe ambition to present updated financial targets in 2019, but considering theuncertainties in the Finnish market, we believe it makes sense to delay newcommitments.There are no shortcuts in the work going forward. For a company like Attendo,the prerequisite for long-term success is the capacity to deliver high andstable quality to satisfied customers, which has been the hallmark of thecompany since the beginning. Customer surveys show that our care is appreciatedand that we are the preferred provider in several locations. But we will not becontent until we have the highest level of satisfaction in every location inwhich we operate - can deliver more care for money spent by local authorities,and at the same time create value for our shareholders.“Summary of the third quarter 2019  · Net sales increased by 8 percent to SEK 3,013m (2,802).

Despite a challenging global trading environment impacting usin the quarter, we are pleased with our underlying performance delivering netsales growth of 2 percent, continued high operating profit and a strong cashflow.Our focus continues to be delivering on initiatives that support our long-termstrategy. A number of key hirings are in place to drive new growth areas andaftermarket focus. The innovation index is rising and is now at 16 percent andwe have seen a 14 percent SKU reduction during the first nine months. I am alsopleased to see inventory reduction progressing at a good rate whilst the openingof a larger site in Mexico in August will make us more competitive goingforward.During the last 18 months we revised and started the execution of our strategyto build an even stronger and more profitable company long term by broadeningour addressable market, increasing our efficiency and further reducing ourexposure to cyclicality and seasonality. As part of our strategy, andconsidering the current market situation, we are now accelerating theoptimization of operational structures by launching a global restructuringprogram. The program focuses on outsourcing of non-core activities andconsolidation of locations. The execution of this program, in combination with astrong financial position, will allow us to deliver on our financial targets andtake full advantage of the many opportunities ahead.The restructuring program is estimated to generate positive annualized effectson earnings of approximately SEK 400 m when fully implemented. We anticipatethat the effect will gradually become apparent from the beginning of 2021,achieving its full impact in the middle of 2022. The cost of implementing theprogram will be around SEK 750 m. It is estimated that the majority of the costwill be charged in the coming 18 months. Approximately 20 locations, includingmanufacturing, warehouses and offices, and 1,500 employees working in theselocations will be affected by the program.In the short term, the uncertainty in some of our markets remains. Due tocontinued challenging market conditions in the Americas and the additionalimpact of US tariffs, the new full year 2019 outlook is negative organic growth,an EBIT margin around 13.5 percent. Leverage excluding acquisitions is expectedto be around 2.4x by the end of 2019.”Juan Vargues President and CEOPRESENTATION OF THE REPORTAnalysts and media are invited to participate in a telephone conference at 10.00(CEST) October 24, 2019, during which President and CEO, Juan Vargues and CFO,Stefan Fristedt, will present the report and answer questions.Sweden: +46 8 519 993 83UK: +44 333 300 9261US: +1 646 722 4956Webcast URL and presentation are available at www.dometic.com.This information is information that Dometic Group AB (publ) is obliged to makepublic pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

During the Alzheimer’s AssociationInternational Conference (AAIC) in July, BioArctic’s co-founder, Professor LarsLannfelt, received a Lifetime Achievement Award, one of the world’s mostprestigious awards in Alzheimer’s disease research, for his discoveries andresearch that led to the drug candidate BAN2401. We are delighted and proud thatLars Lannfelt is recognized for his important scientific contribution to thefield and to BioArctic’s research.The antibody BAN2401 is specifically designed and generated to selectively bindto and eliminate the harmful forms of amyloid beta, called protofibrils, whichare believed to lead to the development of Alzheimer’s disease. This uniquebinding profile was further confirmed with new data presented in July at theAAIC. The results are consistent with what has been seen in previous studieswith BAN2401, but also confirmed that BAN2401 is different from other amyloidbeta antibodies. As previously presented, the large Phase 2b study with BAN2401successfully demonstrated consistent effects on clinical function and biomarkersof disease, as well as a good safety profile. Our partner Eisai presentedadditional supportive data from this study at the AAIC in July. Taken together,these results strengthen BioArctic’s belief that BAN2401’s unique bindingprofile is important and differentiates it from other antibodies’.Our partner Eisai has continued to develop BAN2401 in a stepwise fashion, takingeach next step based on strong data from the previous phase. Based on theresults from the Phase 2b study, the global, confirmatory Phase 3 study (ClarityAD) with BAN2401 is well underway and Eisai expects to receive study results in2022. Eisai is also strongly committed to the overall development of BAN2401. Inaddition to the ongoing Phase 3-study, a Phase 2b open-label extension studywith BAN2401 is ongoing and a further clinical trial aimed at prevention ofAlzheimer’s disease with BAN2401 is planned to start in 2020.BioArctic’s balanced portfolio, with projects from discovery to late clinicalphase, has developed well. During the year, three projects advanced to the nextclinical phase in their respective development program.In the Parkinson’s program, our partner AbbVie continues the Phase 1 study withthe drug candidate ABBV-0805. BioArctic continues to pursue two further researchphase projects within the framework of the ongoing collaboration with AbbVie.With SC0806, intended for complete spinal cord injury, the trial has advanced asplanned and we expect to receive the results of the interim analysis of thefirst panel of the study in Q4 2019/Q1 2020. This will be the first time weanalyze the effect of SC0806, in addition to safety.The technology platform to facilitate passage of antibodies over the blood-brainbarrier is developing well. We are grateful for the grant that we and UppsalaUniversity received together from Vinnova (Sweden’s innovation agency) earlierthis year. We are also pleased to have successfully recruited world-leadingscientists in this area. The research is at an early stage but has already shownvery promising results and the technology has great potential in the treatmentof various brain diseases.BioArctic’s finances remain strong. Our strategic partners fund and progress thecostly clinical studies in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Grantsprimarily fund the clinical development for our complete spinal cord injuryproject. Furthermore, our partnered projects’ progress brings revenues toBioArctic, including the most recent MEUR 15 milestone from Eisai for the startof the Phase 3 clinical study for BAN2401 in May 2019.Our ambition is to develop the medicines of the future that change life forpeople with central nervous system disorders.

Thestrategic review may also result in Handicare remaining in its currentstructure. In order to support the Board in this process, Rothschild has beenappointed as financial advisorsCEO’s CommentsContinued positive growth in Accessibility. Patient Handling Institutional USand Brexit uncertainties impact revenues. The Board has initiated a strategicreview aimed to uncover underlying valueOur efforts to increase focus on quality and customer experience continued inthe quarter. A recent customer survey confirmed Handicare’s leading position inAccessibility and Patient Handling. We have an attractive product offering, astrong geographical presence and a good value proposition. The survey alsopinpointed some areas of improvement, which are already addressed in our programaimed at further improving the customer experience, service quality and theoffering.The improvement measures have been successful and we’re now seeing solid organicrevenue growth on several of our major markets. The launch of the new 1100stairlift was very successful with consistent high order intake on most of ourmarkets. The exceptions in an otherwise solid quarter were the UK, where Brexitconcerns led to lower revenue, and Patient Handling in the US, where revenueswere down year-on-year despite a number of actions initiated.At Group level, negative factors offset some positive progress, and Grouprevenue totaled 65.6 MEUR (65.2) in the third quarter. Operating profit measuredas adjusted EBITA was 4.7 MEUR (5.9), corresponding to a margin of 7.2% (9.1).Profits were negatively impacted by decreased revenue and a lower gross margin,and positively impacted by lower costs. Gross margin fell compared to a strongQ3 in the previous year. The decrease was mainly due to a changed country mixand weak revenues that reduced cost absorption.Progress by business unitQuarterly revenue in the Accessibility business unit totaled 48.0 MEUR (46.6),an increase of 3.1%. The stairlift business delivered organic growth of 3.7%,slightly below our expectations. The lower growth was mainly due to a weakermarket in the UK. We consider the market downturn is due to Brexit, which isgenerating temporary uncertainties at consumer level. Very strong growthcontinued on other major markets such as Germany, the Netherlands and Italy. Thestrategically important North American market made solid progress and greworganically by 9% in the quarter. Overall, we foresee continued long-termprofitability and growth potential for the stairlift business. VehicleAccessibility developed according to plan and delivered organic growth in thequarter.Sales in the Patient Handling business unit totaled 17.6 MEUR (18.6). Canadaprogressed as expected, while the effects from the improvement initiatives inthe US are taking longer than anticipated. We expected the reorganization andimproved sales processes to take effect in the third quarter. It takes time forall the measures to feed through and to achieve the full effect of new salesstaff focusing on institutional customers with longer sales cycles. We continueto drive sales effectiveness, a stronger geographical presence and an improvedproduct, service and delivery offering. Progress is moving in the rightdirection, and all installation engineers in Patient Handling in the US arefully booked in the fourth quarter. We expect our initiatives to yield resultsduring the first half of 2020.New product launches and innovationAfter the summer, I’ve had the opportunity to visit most of our key markets inEurope and attended the launch of our new 1100 stairlift in the US. We receivedvery positive feedback on the launch a clear confirmation of the strength ofthe Handicare brand, and that our investments in innovation and productdevelopment are providing return on investment. The reception has been verypositive across the board and has led to several new customers and increasedshare-of-wallet from existing customers. It is my ambition to continue thecustomer-oriented innovation and strengthen Handicare as a supplier of premiumproducts to further improve our position as the market leader in stairlifts.Changed outlook 2019Based on lower revenue than anticipated in the third quarter, we expect organicgrowth in the second half-year of 2019 to be lower than previously communicatedforecast of 4 - 6%. We retain the outlook for an improved adjusted EBITA marginin the second half of the year compared to the first half (8.4%).The Board has decided to review a range of strategic optionsWe’re a leading player on attractive markets with demographically driven growth.The extensive and important improvement measures that have been implemented overthe past 12 months have not yet fed through to improved results. However, I’mconvinced that we’re on the right track and that we’ve built a solid foundationfor profitable growth in line with our financial targets.

Munters Group AB,2019-10-24 08:00:00,"Stable demand, strong organic net sales growth and improved profitabilityIn September 2019, the closure of the Data Center Factory in Dison, Belgium, wasdecided. This business is reported as discontinued operations in this interimreport and the income statement for 2019 and 2018 has been restated to reflectthis change. The CEO comments and business comments in this report focus on thecontinuing operations, unless otherwise stated.CEO commentsMarket conditions stableOverall, markets in the third quarter were characterized by stable demand.Demand remained strong in some areas of the industrial market, Services as wellas for Data Centers and Mist Elimination solutions. We also saw increased demandfor digitalized solutions for the food industry. Order intake in Asia improveddriven by high demand from the poultry industry and investments in swineproduction, coming back from low levels due to the African Swine Fever. Theorder intake was solid in the US due to strong order intake from Data Centers inthe US and a few orders from the lithium battery industry, despite a continuedweak commercial market. In the third quarter, selected parts of the Europeanindustrial market saw lower demand, impacted by a weaker economic climate andlower investment rate in the region. We still anticipate softer Group orderintake development during the second half of the year versus the first half year2019.Continued strong organic sales growthMunters net sales grew 11% organically in the quarter, resulting in an organicgrowth of 8% for the first nine months. Growth was partly driven by the stronggrowth in the Data Centers business in the US, where the business delivered onthe strategic direction set last year. We also saw good net sales increase inseveral sub-segments in the industrial areas. Our focus on growing the area ofServices is continuing to deliver strong increase in net sales.Adjusted EBITA-improvedEarly 2019 Munters launched a three-phase program, the Munters Full PotentialProgram, FPP, to reach our mid-term financial targets. The total run-rateoverhead cost savings from the FPP are estimated to SEKm 160, of which savingsof SEKm 155, on an annual basis, have been achieved at the end of September, inline with the targeted level. We are confident we will reach targeted run-ratesavings for 2019 and onwards. Since I joined as CEO, a review has been made ofthe initiatives in the FPP program. This has resulted in a change in theestimate for non-recurring costs for the full year 2019 from, as previouslycommunicated SEKm 350 to SEKm 375, due to depreciation of assets related to theclosure of the Data Center factory in Dison, Belgium. The closure of thisfactory was decided in the third quarter and this operation is now reported asdiscountinued operations. At September 30, SEKm 326 had been recorded as non-recurring charges for the FPP. In addition, and as previously communicated, inconnection with the closure of the factory in Dison, a provision has been madefor an estimated non-recurring charge of SEKm 116. This was related to certainspecified components, for a previously sold customized Munters solution, havingto be replaced at a specific customer’s sites.In the first nine months, net sales growth and good progress in savings from theFPP led to an improved adjusted EBITA margin. Adjusted EBITA amounted to SEKm248, and adjusted EBITA-margin was 13.7% in the third quarter. Discontinuedoperations reported EBITA of SEKm -19 in the quarter.Towards a more profitable companyIn the coming quarters I will focus on driving steady, continuous improvementsin order to solidify a stable base for Munters. Operational excellence is keyfor us and imperative in order to create room for continued investments infuture growth initiatives. I am very happy that Peter Gisel-Ekdal, after 12years at the helm of the business area FoodTech has accepted to head up thebusiness area AirTech. Over the coming months I, together with the organization,will focus on setting the strategic priorities that will guide us over the yearsto come, including a finalization of the strategic evaluation of the Data Centerand Mist Elimination businesses.Klas Forsström, President and CEO[image]At 9:00 the President and CEO, Klas Forsström, together with the Group VicePresident and CFO, Annette Kumlien will present the report in an audiocast withtelephone conference.Audiocast:http://www.financialhearings.com/event/11800Dial-in number for the telephone conference:SE: +46850558365UK: +443333009032US: +18335268395The interim report, presentation material and a link to the audiocast will beavailable on https://www.munters.com/en/investor-relations/For more information, please contact:Ann-Sofi Jönsson, Head of Investor RelationsPhone: + 46 (0)730 251 005Email: ann-sofi.jonsson@munters.seThis information is information that Munters Group AB is obliged to make publicpursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Securities Markets Act.

Trelleborg AB,2019-10-24 07:45:00,"""More demanding environment""“The third quarter was marked by a somewhat weaker organic sales trend in anumber of market segments, which was partly offset by a good development in theaerospace segment as well as a significant sales increase in oil & gas andinfrastructure solutions. Overall, organic sales decreased by 1 percent and by 3percent excluding our positive project transactions. Operating profit declined 9percent, mainly due to reduced sales and stock adjustments in Trelleborg WheelSystems.At the end of the second quarter, we announced cost-saving measures to addressan anticipated lower level of demand. The effects of these initiatives willprimarily have an impact toward the end of the year and during 2020. Anincreased focus on working capital contributed to strong cash flow.The industrial trend is generally weaker in most geographical markets comparedwith the first half of the year, probably affected by the trade conflict betweenthe US and China, as well as the uncertainty related to Brexit. This globaleconomic slowdown has impacted sales volumes, not least to customers in theautomotive and general engineering industries for both Trelleborg SealingSolutions and Trelleborg Industrial Solutions. Customer activity in theaerospace industry and for our project-related operations related to oil & gasand infrastructure construction remains at a high level.The demand for tires in both the agriculture sector and tires for materialhandling and construction vehicles continued to decline during the quarter inmost markets. We made a decision to keep production below the level of demand inorder to adapt our stock levels to a weaker market situation, which has had anegative earnings impact in Trelleborg Wheel Systems. During the period, wetransferred production between facilities to meet new trading patterns and tocreate a better production structure for the future. Together, inventoryadjustments and production transfers have contributed to temporarily reducedefficiency and increased costs, which will also impact the business area’searnings during the next quarter in a corresponding manner.Overall, our assessment is that the demand in the last quarter of the year willbe on a par with the third quarter, and with an unfavorable sales mix similar towhat we saw during the third quarter. As previously, we are carefully monitoringeconomic developments and stand well prepared to manage fluctuating marketconditions,” says Peter Nilsson, President and CEO.Third quarterNet sales for the third quarter of 2019 rose 6 percent to SEK 8,828 M (8,300).Organic sales declined 1 percent for the Group in its entirety, and declined 3percent, excluding project deliveries.EBIT, excluding items affecting comparability, amounted to SEK 1,036 M (1,133),which was equivalent to an EBIT margin of 11.7 percent (13.6).Items affecting comparability for the quarter were a negative SEK 127 M (neg:28) and pertained to restructuring costs. At the end of the second quarter, anaction program was launched and communicated to address an anticipated downturnin certain market segments. Restructuring costs for the full year is estimatedto approximately SEK 500 M.The Trelleborg Offshore & Construction business area recognized a positiveresult for the first time since the first quarter of 2017.Earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, totaled SEK 2.83(2.98). For the Group, earnings per share amounted to SEK 2.44 (2.88).Operating cash flow amounted to SEK 1,413 M (854).

Other activities related to efficiencyimprovements have led to the strengthening of the gross margin by 0.4 percentagepoints during the quarter compared to last year.Tonnage and sales growthDuring the quarter, we had a 12 percent negative tonnage growth in business areaSweden & Poland and a sales decline by 14 percent as a result of decliningdemand from both the construction and manufacturing industry.In business area Finland & Baltics the tough competition continues combined withnegative signals from the large OEM customers in Finland. Meanwhile, we seelower activity in the Baltic markets. This led to a negative tonnage growth by10 percent and a sales decrease by 9 percent compared with the same quarter inthe previous year. The lower operating result could not be fully compensated bylower working capital, which resulted in a negative cash flow during the period.Efficiency improvements and investmentsWe see an economic downturn and focus ahead is on efficiency improvements andtaking market shares. The investments in Norrköping give us an opportunity togain strength and to be even more competitive.Peter Andersson, President and CEOFor further information, please contact:Peter Andersson, President and CEOtel: + 46 706 53 76 55, e-post: peter.andersson@begroup.comDaniel Fäldt, CFOtel: +46 (0)705-60 31 75, e-mail: daniel.faldt@begroup.comThis information is information that BE Group AB (publ) is obliged to makepublic pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

Adjusted earnings perordinary share, excluding impairment of intangible assets of SEK 328 million,was SEK 1.31Events after the reporting period  · Andreas Stenbäck took over as CFO of Volati AB (publ) on 1 October  · Väggmaterial i Sverige AB was consolidated with effect from 2 October  · During October, 1 million ordinary shares held by the Company werewithdrawn. In addition, shares in subsidiaries were transferred to keyindividuals in Volati’s business units, both in accordance with the decision ofthe Extraordinary General Meeting on 30 SeptemberCOMMENTS FROM THE CEOContinuation of good growth in sales and EBITA in Q3Net sales increased by 16 percent to SEK 1,711 million and EBITA increased by 24percent to SEK 153 million. Behind the figures are contributions from acquiredcompanies and continuing good development for the existing operations. OrganicEBITA growth was 4 percent. It is our assessment that the medium-term profittrend for two of Consumer’s business units, NaturaMed Pharma and me&i, does notmeasure up to our previous expectations of improved profitability. This hasunfortunately resulted in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of SEK328 million in Q3.Akademibokhandeln increased sales and earningsThe Akademibokhandeln business area continued its positive trend during Q3. Bothsales and earnings improved compared with the same period the previous year. Thebusiness area experienced good demand in the core range and strong developmentin its non-book segment during the quarter. This, together with a continuedfocus on costs and margins, has had a positive impact on profitability. TheBokus e-commerce channel also continued the trend from Q2, increasing its salesvolume while improving margins.Stable quarter for the Trading business areaThroughout the year, the Trading business area has been challenged by the weakerkrona, as most of the companies import their products. We are very pleased withhow well the business area has managed to meet the challenge by working on bothcosts and price adjustments. We can confirm that demand for the business area’sproducts has remained good during the quarter.Sales and earnings growth for the Industry business areaWe are pleased with the performance of the business area, which has increasedboth its sales and earnings. However, the business area’s operations are subjectto natural fluctuations in demand, as we also deal with project sales and otheroperations affected by seasonality. These fluctuations in demand have had anegative impact on earnings.Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the Consumer business areaIn Q3, we recognised a total impairment loss of SEK 328 million on goodwill andintangible assets in two of Consumer’s business units – NaturaMed Pharma andme&i. This was based on our assessment that the medium-term profit trend for thebusiness units will be lower than our previous expectations. We continue to workclosely with the business units on relevant measures. Both NaturaMed Pharma andme&i are profitable.The vehicle inspection business in the Consumer business area had a good thirdquarter. Besikta has handled the effects of the rule changes introduced in 2018very efficiently. In simple terms, the rules have extended inspection intervalsfrom 12 to 14 months, which has had an adverse effect on the customer base forthe entire sector. By working on staffing, costs and pricing, the business unitis now back to profitability in line with how it was before the change, with astrong market position.Large inflow of potential acquisitionsDuring the quarter, we were able to welcome Väggmaterial AB into the Volatifamily. The acquisition, an add-on acquisition for Trading, broadens thebusiness area’s offering to the Swedish building materials and paint retailsector. We have seen an increased inflow of potential acquisition candidatesduring the quarter. We have a strong brand in the acquisition market and are agood owner of companies in a range of sectors, notably in building materials andhardware. What is more, the number of companies seeking new owners has increasedin the current phase of the economic cycle. It is vital for us to strike theright balance in terms of the acquisitions we should go for and the ones weshould reject. The focus is, as always, on companies’ capacity for long-termearnings and value creation.Good financial position and scope for acquisitionsAs I mentioned at the start, the operations have performed well during Q3 and wecontinue to show a good financial position. Net debt to EBITDA ended the quarterat 2.2x, which is well within our target of net debt to EBITDA of no more than3.0x. Due to seasonality, it is also important to remember that Q4 is normallyVolati’s strongest quarter for earnings and cash flow. In other words, we havegood financial scope to make further acquisitions when the right opportunitiesarise.Mårten Andersson, President and CEOConference callCEO Mårten Andersson and CFO Andreas Stenbäck will present the interim report ina conference call on 24 October at 15.00.

TOBII AB,2019-10-24 07:30:00,"Tobii AB (publ) today announced its interim report for the third quarter of2019.Comment by Tobii’s CEO Henrik Eskilsson:“Substantial profitability improvements in Tobii Dynavox and Tobii Pro.Revenues in the quarter increased by 15 percent, or 8 percent adjusted forcurrency effects, compared with the third quarter of 2018. Operating margins inTobii Dynavox and Tobii Pro increased substantially to 14 percent and 13percent, respectively, while external revenues in Tobii Tech doubled. We alsolaunched two important new products that lay the foundation for continuedprofitable growth for a long time to come.”Third quarter July-September 2019  ·  The Group’s revenues rose by 15% to SEK 359 million (313) compared with thethird quarter of 2018. Adjusted for currency effects, the increase was 8%.  ·  The gross margin was 69% (71%).  · The Group's operating loss amounted to SEK -32 million (-60).Tobii Dynavox contributed SEK 30 million (18) and Tobii Pro SEK 13 million (4)to earnings, while investments in Tobii Tech had an impact of SEK -73 million (-82) on the Group's operating loss  · Earnings per share amounted to SEK -0.32 (-0.70)  · Beginning with this report, earnings related to Smartbox are recognized as""Net profit/loss for the period from discontinued operations"", with no effect onoperating profit or loss at the Group or Division level. Comparative periods arerecognized in a similar way. All Smart-box-related balance sheet items arerecognized beginning on Sept. 30, 2019 as “Held for sale assets” or “Liabilitiesdirectly related to assets held for sale”.Significant events  · Dell’s eye tracking equipped Alienware m15 and m17 gaming laptops began tobe sold in volume during the quarter and were the driver for the doubledexternal revenues within Tobii Tech.  · At the Siggraph conference for computer graphics, Tobii Tech presented itsSpotlight technology, which optimizes the ability to process graphics in highdetail only where the user is looking.  · The British Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) required Tobii to divestSmartbox, which Tobii acquired autumn 2018. Tobii appealed the decision.Significant events after the end of the period  · Tobii Dynavox launched the new I-Series, the division’s medical-grade andeye-controlled flagship product.  · Tobii Pro launched Tobii Pro Fusion, a new portable high-performance eyetracker for research.Comments from the CEORevenues in the quarter increased by 15 percent, or 8 percent adjusted forcurrency effects, compared with the third quarter of 2018. Operating margins inTobii Dynavox and Tobii Pro increased substantially to 14 percent and 13percent, respectively, while external revenues in Tobii Tech doubled. We alsolaunched two important new products that lay the foundation for continuedprofitable growth for a long time to come.Tobii Dynavox delivered a strongly improved EBIT margin of 14 percent in thethird quarter.A few days ago, we launched a completely new generation of the I-Series, thedivision’s medical-grade and eye-controlled flagship product. The I-Seriesaccounts for half of Tobii Dynavox’s total sales and the launch of the new I-Series is therefore extremely important for both the division and for the Groupas a whole. The new I-Series has been redesigned from ground up and contains anumber of innovations that make it the most easy-to-use, durable and advancedproduct of its kind on the market. The launch lays the foundation for continuedstrong and profitable growth in the division for a long time to come. Revenuesgrowth for the quarter was 6 percent. Adjusted for currency effects, however,revenues were in line with the previous year, which can mainly be attributed tolower sales of the old I-Series in conjunction with the transition to the newproduct. The British Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has required us todivest Smartbox and we have therefore initiated a sale of the business, but wealso appealed the decision. Beginning with this quarter, Smartbox is reportedseparately and does not affect the operating income of either Tobii Group orTobii Dynavox. The comparative quarters have been adjusted in a similar way.Tobii Pro also posted a strong improvement in operating profit for the quarter.The EBIT margin was 13 percent and revenues rose by 18 percent, or 10 percentafter adjustment for currency effects.After the end of the quarter, Tobii Pro launched its new portable high-performance eye tracker for research, Tobii Pro Fusion. The product makes iteasier for researchers to go outside the lab to carry out studies in naturalenvironments in fields such as behavioral science, psychology, neuroscience andmedicine. Together, the analytics software Tobii Pro Lab, the recently launchedentry-level model Tobii Pro Nano, the new Tobii Pro Fusion, the top of the lineTobii Pro Spectrum and Tobii Pro Glasses 2 comprise a broad and industry leadingportfolio of portable, stationary and mobile eye-tracking solutions for studiesof human behavior.In Tobii Tech, revenues to external customers increased by 101%, or 86% afteradjustment for currency effects. The corresponding increases for total revenueswere 44 percent and 33 percent, respectively. This quarter, it was mainly the PCsegment and sales of Dell’s Alienware m15 and m17 laptops that contributed torevenue growth, while revenues within the Niche application segment and project-related revenue in VR were lower than usual. Internal revenues declined,primarily because of the ongoing product transition to the new I-Series. TobiiTech presented its Spotlight technology at the Siggraph conference in late July,where we held a panel discussion on the technology together with nVidia and HTC.Spotlight optimizes the ability to process the graphics in high detail onlywhere the user is looking, which makes it possible to maximize graphicsperformance in Virtual Reality. This is known as “Foveated Rendering” and is oneof the main reasons why eye tracking is on the way to becoming a standard in thefield. We are as previously communicated, involved in integration projects witha handful of customers in VR and during the quarter we took important stepsforward both in ongoing projects and new collaborations.All in all, we achieved strongly improved profitability in both Tobii Pro andTobii Dynavox, combined with a substantial increase in external revenues inTobii Tech. We also carried out two key product launches that will lay thefoundation for continued strong and profitable growth for many years to come.Conference callToday at 1:00 p.m. CEST, Tobii will host a conference call with web castpresentation for media, analyst and investors.

Edgeware AB,2019-10-24 07:30:00,"""The company is on a journey of change and the successful launch of our newproduct, StreamPilot, was an important station on this journey"" Karl Thedéen,CEO EdgewareTHIRD QUARTER 2019:  · Net sales totalled SEK 43.1 million (54.5), a decrease of 21.0 percent.  · Net sales totalled SEK 40.5 million (54.5), excluding newly acquired CavenaImage Products AB, a decrease of 25.7 percent.  · Gross profit amounted to SEK 28.8 million (39.0), corresponding to a grossmargin of 66.9 percent (71.7).  · Gross profit amounted to SEK 27.2 million (39.0), excluding newly acquiredCavena Image Products AB, corresponding to a gross margin of 67.1 percent(71.7).  · Operating income (EBIT) was negative SEK 3.6 million (pos: 3.0),corresponding to an operating margin of negative 8.4 percent (pos: 5.5).  · Loss for the period amounted to SEK 2.4 million (profit: 3.3).  · Cash flow from operating activities totalled SEK 5.9 million (13.0).  · Cash flow for the period was SEK 2.0 million (7.0).JANUARY-SEPTEMBER 2019:  · Net sales totalled SEK 126.9 million (152.9), a decrease of 17.0 percent.  · Net sales totalled SEK 116.4 million (152.9), excluding newly acquiredCavena Image Products AB, a decrease of 23.9 percent.  · Gross profit amounted to SEK 85.6 million (103.6), corresponding to a grossmargin of 67.4 percent (67.8).  · Gross profit amounted to SEK 76.4 million (103.6), excluding newly acquiredCavena Image Products AB, corresponding to a gross margin of 65.6 percent(67.8).  · Operating income (EBIT) amounted to negative SEK 25.6 million (neg: 23.7),corresponding to an operating margin of negative 20.3 percent (neg: 15.5).  · Loss for the period amounted to SEK 18.4 million (loss: 17.2).  · Cash flow from operating activities totalled SEK 5.9 million (neg: 8.8).  · Cash flow for the period was negative SEK 18.6 million (neg: 21.6). Thisincludes the cash-flow effect attributable to the acquisition of Cavena ImageProducts AB of SEK 9.1 million *.SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER  · Edgeware launched StreamPilot for unique multi-CDN control.  · Edgeware’s customer GO is using Edgeware’s technology to transform TVviewing in Malta.COMMENTS BY THE CEOSales for the third quarter totalled SEK 43 million, which is 21 percent lowerthan the year-earlier quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a decline inLatin America, where our business typically depends a lot on revenue from a fewcustomers. The current decline in our CDN business with telecom operators inWestern Europe, which we have referred to earlier, has however continued toimpact us and we noted an ongoing low order intake from these customers duringthe quarter. Lower sales had a somewhat negative impact on our gross margin,which amounted to 67 percent for the quarter. Total EBIT was a negative SEK 3.6million.We can see continued growth potential for our CDN business in China, where weare focusing on opportunities with new cable operator customers and in LatinAmerica, where we have one major key reference customer. We additionally noted apositive trend for our revenue from services which grew and amounted to SEK 19million for the interim period. During the quarter, we also communicated thatone of our existing customers, Maltese GO, is using our CDN and Origin productsto provide its subscribers with a flexible TV experience on smartphones, tabletsand  computers in addition to the television service provided via a set-top boxfor home appliances. I can see similar business opportunities for many of ourexisting customers. The acquired company Cavena reported a stable performanceand increased sales compared with the year-earlier period.The most important event in the quarter was the launch of our new StreamPilotplatform, which took place at the IBC trade fair in Amsterdam. StreamPilotenables customers to monitor, control and optimise the delivery of streamingvideo across several different CDN networks in real time, which is currentlydifficult but crucial in the delivery of a high-quality user experience. Ourplatform is unique as it is completely independent of CDN networks and requiresno change to software installed in mobile phones, iPads or TVs. We held meetingswith more than 100 companies at our booth at IBC who confirmed that StreamPilotaddresses a major problem and enables new revenue from both our existing andpotential new customers. StreamPilot also expands our cloud-based offering,Edgeware Cloud Service, in addition to the previously launched products withinthe Origin solution.The investment in cloud-based services is a critical element for us. Cloud-basedservices are particularly suitable for customers in the broadcaster segment andalso offer us an opportunity to increase our share of recurring revenue. In thefourth quarter, we will conduct pilot projects with StreamPilot, which, ifsuccessful, can be converted into customer orders in the first half of nextyear.However, I expect the low business volumes with our largest customers in WesternEurope to remain at lower levels going into fourth quarter 2019. Subscribergrowth in these networks is limited and the use of new services, such as time-shift, is not increasing significantly. Taken together, this means there is nogreat need for investments in additional capacity. However, there are a numberof events next year that could change the market situation. These include theUEFA European Football Championship and the Olympic Games in Tokyo as well as ageneral increased focus on video in 4K resolution. These types of events havepreviously driven investments, though it is still too early to see how they willimpact our business in 2020.To summarise, Edgeware is in the midst of a major commercial process of change.We have one major business that has declined at the same time as we can see newopportunities for the CDN business in growth markets, for services and for newproducts targeting new and existing customers. We will retain a strong focus oncosts and on controlling and freeing up resources to invest in new products andin new business. During the quarter, for example, we restructured our salesorganisation and established closer relations between the regions andheadquarter functions.

In total, demand in theNordic region grew by just over 5% during the quarter, which is strong givensignals of lower global economic growth. It is also gratifying to see positiveeffects from our increased and more focused market initiatives at the same timeas customer satisfaction has improved.Active portfolio management and a strong pipelineIn August, we successfully opened the Scandic Falkoner hotel and event venue inCopenhagen’s Frederiksberg theater district, with high occupancy from day one.During the quarter, we also signed an agreement for a new hotel and conferencecenter in Aarhus, Denmark.

Thesenew players are being converted from other game categories, such as slots, whichis very encouraging to see. Through our expansion and construction of studiocapacity, together with the 10 new games launched during the first half of 2019,we are also favourably positioned to take advantage of the growing generaldemand for Live.Revenues in the third quarter amounted to EUR 94.7 million, an increase of 47percent compared to last year. EBITDA amounted to EUR 48.5 million, with amargin of 51.2 percent. For the nine-month period, the EBITDA margin was 48.9percent. Based on this outcome, we will end up slightly above the previouslycommunicated margin range of 47-49 percent for the 2019 full year.Evolution’s products experience high demand all over the world, which can beseen in our growth which is truly global. To increase the understanding of ourgeographical reach, starting in this report we will break down our revenues perregion. We are growing together with our customers in all regions, with thehighest growth in Asia and North America. We expect this development to continueand it reflects the operators’ focus on new growth markets.

Currently, weoffer 9 out of 21 game titles from our portfolio to operators in the state.During the quarter, we received an Interactive Gaming Manufacturer licence fromthe Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, which is a prerequisite to be able tooffer our services in Pennsylvania. Based on our experience in New Jersey, wesee great opportunities to attract both online operators and land-based casinoswith our offering. Planning for the studio is in full swing with launch during2020.After the end of the quarter we have signed an agreement with FlutterEntertainment and its successful brands Paddy Power and Betfair. The deal is theresult of a dialogue that has been going on for many years, and which has beenintensified thanks to our latest innovations. We look forward to developing thispartnership over time.For us, 2019 has been a year of products and innovation. We have furtherstrengthened our development capabilities and going forward, we will keep up thepace in the development of new games.

We have not onlydelivered on our profitable growth commitment, but Viaplay has continued to addsubscribers at a healthy rate and are now up 25% in the twelve months. We haveshifted to a functional operating model that will make us faster and moreefficient, and we will launch Viaplay in Iceland in H1 2020. Furthermore, weyesterday announced an agreement to create a 50/50 joint venture between ViasatConsumer and Canal Digital, which is expected to yield substantial synergies anddrive shareholder value.”The positive momentum seen in H1 continued into Q3 with higher sales and profitsfor both operating segments. Group sales were up 10% on an organic basis andoperating income for our combined business segments was up 3% despite US dollartransactional headwinds of SEK 20m. Our central operation costs were upfollowing initial costs related to the Viasat Consumer / Canal Digitalcombination.Our Broadcasting & Streaming operations delivered their 12th consecutive quarterof profitable growth, which demonstrates the positive effect of our investmentsinto the streaming market. Subscription & Other sales, which accounted for 63%of Group sales, were up 11%. We added 37k Viaplay subscribers, compared to aloss of 13k last year, and the base has grown over 25% in the last twelve monthsto 1,459k. The expansion to Iceland in the first half of next year is in linewith our strategy, and reflects the strength of our content, the attraction ofsuch a highly connected society, and the fact that our technology is built to beable to scale efficiently and effectively.Advertising sales, which accounted for 22% of Group sales, were up 2% as higherprices offset the continuing fall in linear TV viewing levels. We are nowentering the 2020 annual advertising contract negotiations and, while it's fartoo early to indicate the outcome, it is clear that demand for TV advertisingremains high even if there is a shortage of inventory supply. We do thereforeexpect prices to continue to rise.NENT Studios, which accounted for 15% of Group sales, generated 32% growth,primarily on the back of exceptional performance in the scripted drama but alsofrom double digit growth in non-scripted productions. Operating profits werealso up despite the investments we have made into our US based operations.We also announced a new organisation and operating model in September, which weare now implementing. We are moving from a country based model to a structurebased on focused areas of responsibility working across markets, products andbrands. The new structure will help us to take decisions faster, scale flexibly,and generate significant savings to enable our continuing investment intocontent and technology.We have also acquired the exclusive rights to the Ice Hockey World Championshipfrom 2024 to 2028. We already show the tournament in Sweden and will now expandthe coverage to the entire Nordic region as part of our unrivalled winter sportsoffering.Yesterday’s announcement of the combination of our satellite and broadband-TVbusiness with Canal Digital is a very important milestone for us. I am convincedthat this combination will not only create significant shareholder value, butalso allow for continued investments into the business and its subscriberoffering. This combination is perfectly in line with our strategy to prioritisethe substantial opportunity that we see in the streaming market.Anders JensenPresident & CEOShareholder information2020 Annual General MeetingThe 2020 Annual General Meeting will be held on Tuesday 19 May 2020 inStockholm.

Haldex AB,2019-10-24 07:20:00,"Stable quarter on a further weakened marketThe currency-adjusted net sales for Q3 decreased by 4 per cent compared to thesame period the previous year. In North America, Haldex increased its net salesby 2 per cent during the quarter despite signs that the market is weakening. InEurope, net sales decreased by 7 percent due to a weaker market, primarily inthe Trailer segment. Net sales also decreased in China primarily due to lowersales of brake adjusters compared to an unusually strong comparison quarter.The operating income excluding one-off items increased 7 per cent compared tothe previous year. This increase is largely due to higher sales to the moreprofitable aftermarket. Cash flow from operating activities was somewhatstronger compared to the previous year.Forecast adjustmentDue to the weaker market conditions, the forecast for the full year has beenadjusted slightly downward. The new assessment is that net sales and theoperating margin excluding one-off items will be somewhat lower than theprevious year. The assessment had been made earlier that net sales would be inline with the previous year and that the operating margin excluding one-offitems would be in line with or higher than the previous year. The long-termtarget of an operating margin of 10 per cent, excluding investments in newtechnology, by 2022 is still in place.Relocation of productionAfter the end of the quarter, two major production changes were announced thatwill result in annual savings of SEK 75 m once the relocation of production hasbeen completed.Key figures for July - September 2019(same period previous year in brackets)•    Net sales, SEK m   1,283 (1,270)•    Operating income, SEK m    68 (79)•    Operating income, excl. one-off items, SEK m    85 (79)•    Operating margin, %   5.3 (6.3)•    Operating margin, excl. one-off items, %   6.6 (6.3)•    Operating margin, excl. investments in new technology, % 7.4 (-)•    Return on capital employed,% 1    7.5 (12.5)•    Return on capital employed, excl. one-off items,%1     10.5 (13.8)•    Net income, SEK m    37 (58)•    Earnings per share, SEK   0.83 (1.30)•    Cash flow, operating activities, SEK m   76 (74)1)    Rolling twelve monthsKey figures for January - September 2019(same period previous year in brackets)•    Net sales, SEK m   4,010 (3,894)•    Operating income, SEK m    238 (267)•    Operating income, excl. one-off items, SEK m    273 (267)•    Operating margin, %   5.9 (6.9)•    Operating margin, excl. one-off items, %   6.8 (6.9)•    Operating margin, excl. investments in new technology, % 7.5 (-)•    Return on capital employed,% 1    7.5 (12.5)•    Return on capital employed, excl. one-off items,%1     10.5 (13.8)•    Net income, SEK m    154 (177)•    Earnings per share, SEK   3.48 (3.95)•    Cash flow, operating activities, SEK m   89 (75)2)    Rolling twelve monthsComment from Helene Svahn, President & CEO:“The third quarter for Haldex was also my first quarter as CEO of the company.For me, both the opportunities and the challenges are beginning to come moreinto focus the more I learn about the operations. After having met colleagues,customers, suppliers, investors and potential new partners, I can see thatHaldex holds a unique position.Through our business mix of development, production and sales of establishedcomponents, and a large percentage of the non-cyclical aftermarket, we arestanding on solid ground. We also have leading technological solutions for thevehicles of the future, which is a good sign as we approach the exciting andmost likely steep developmental curve that awaits the industry in the nearfuture. The stable core business provides the financing for the journey we haveembarked upon as we transition from being a component supplier to a systemprovider within brake, suspension and other related systems.Despite favourable conditions, the work that lies ahead will be demanding.Improved cash flows from the core business are necessary to be able to financethe development of new systems. To reach our target margin of 10 per cent (EBITmargin, excluding new technology) by 2022, we need to shift up a gear,particularly within three identified main areas:•    Streamlining market and customer excellence to ensure that we are choosingthe right customers, offering the right products, and selling at the rightprice.•    Improvement of internal processes and workflows to ensure that we areadapting our costs, improving our logistics flows, and reducing the number ofsuppliers.•    Reduction in the number of production facilities to enable economies ofscale in other facilities and reduce complexity and administrative costs.These initiatives will incur one-time costs, but the costs will prove to benecessary to achieve our overarching goals. In accordance with the decision toreduce the number of production facilities, we recently announced the closure ofthe factories in Blue Springs and Heidelberg, which will result in annualsavings of SEK 75 million.Within components, we are active in a large number of customer segments. Inorder to streamline our work with markets and customers, we should increase ourmarket shares in attractive segments and actively step away from less attractivesegments. The potential for Haldex in Asia means that this market will be keymoving forward.In terms of our products for the aftermarket, which represents a large part ofour profit, we must ensure that we are taking the share of the spare partsmarket that our sales to vehicle manufacturers make possible. This requiresproactive management of logistics companies and a greater focus on, for example,Eastern Europe. These initiatives will become particularly important when thesignals indicating weaker demand on the market become stronger, now, even inNorth America, which had good growth during the year. The quarter shows, forexample, reduced order intake from the Trailer market in Europe.At the same time as we have begun to take serious steps to clarify our long-termfocus, I can point to several successes in the right direction, which shows thatour goals are ambitious but realistic.We are actively advancing our positions within new technology. During thequarter, we extended our framework agreement with one of the world’s largesttruck manufacturers for the development of brake and suspension systems for self-driving and electric vehicles.We also reached significant milestones during the quarter in our development ofthe electromechanical disc brake with the approval by the Chinese authoritiesand the successful test installation in several customers’ vehicles.We are seeing the benefits of working in partnerships. One example is ourcooperation with Daimler, where we together successfully developed disc brakesfor their trucks. Based on this background, Daimler decided during the quarterto begin serial production of disc brakes together with Haldex for theirvehicles.Another noteworthy event during the third quarter is that Haldex’s ownershipstructure changed following ZF’s divestment of its entire ownership stake of 20per cent. We are very positive about this divestment, since it leads to improvedcompetition and greater possibilities for large transactions with vehiclemanufacturers. Work is also under way to further improve the long-term ownershipstructure.In conclusion, I can say that the third quarter has been positive, both for meas the new CEO and for the company. A final challenging quarter awaits, as wellas several exciting years during which the vehicle industry will undergo aradical transformation and existing competitive advantages will change. It is onthis constantly changing market that there is true potential, unchartedterritory, where Haldex, by being fast, innovative, curious and resolute, willbe able to take a leading position. I am looking forward to equipping Haldex tomeet challenges and freeing its potential and possibilities, both in the shortterm and the long term.”Full interim reportThe full interim report is available athttp://corporate.haldex.com/en/investors/financialreports or athttp://news.cision.com/haldexPress and analyst meetingMedia and analysts are invited to a telephone conference at which the reportwill be presented with comments by Helene Svahn, President & CEO and AndreasLarsson, CFO.

BillerudKorsnäs AB,2019-10-24 07:00:00,"Strong financial positionKey highlights  · Underlying sales and profitability growth excluding the KM7 impact  · Strong balance sheet after sale of a majority stake in Bergvik Skog Öst  · Increased focus on efficiency and profitabilityQuarterly data  · Net sales declined by 4% to SEK 5 833 million (6 054), driven mainly byvolume and mix impact of KM7 start-up.  · Adjusted EBITDA* was SEK 639 million (893), negatively impacted by KM7 start-up effects of around SEK 280 million.  · Operating profit was SEK 149 million (513).  · Net profit was SEK 5 754 million (363), including profit from discontinuedoperations of SEK 5 677 million.  · Earnings per share amounted to SEK 27.83 (1.76). Adjusted earnings per sharewere SEK 0.48 (1.85).Q4 Outlook  · The market for Division Board is expected to be stable.  · Weaker market conditions in some segments, particularly brown sack paper andkraft paper for industrial use, with an increased pricing pressure.  · Slightly lower total cost of fibre due to lower pulpwood prices.COMMENTS BY CEO“The start-up effects for KM7 have been significant and the underlying sales andearnings grew”Demand for sustainable packaging remains high and BillerudKorsnäs’ marketposition and know-how are creating good opportunities for long-term growth.However, in the third quarter uncertainty in the global board and paper marketincreased and the fibre costs remained at historic high levels.In the short term, revenues and earnings are being impacted by start-up effectsof the new board machine at Gruvön, with a negative impact on sales growthcompared with the equivalent period last year of 5 percentage points, and onEBITDA of approximately SEK 280 million in the third quarter. When adjusting forthe KM7 start-up effects underlying adjusted EBITDA grew in the quarter. Theramp-up of KM7 is continuing and the machine is producing good quality materialsthat are receiving positive customer feedback and the production availability isimproving. For the remainder of the year we will be focusing on increasingavailability of the machine and the certification process is planned to start inthe first half of next year. For years ahead the KM7 investment at Gruvön willprovide BillerudKorsnäs with a platform for growth in attractive and steadilygrowing segments. When fully ramped up in 2023, this machine is expected toproduce 550 000 tonnes annually.The completion of the Bergvik Skog Öst transaction took place on 30 August andimplied a positive cash flow of SEK 7.6 billion and a capital gain of SEK 5.6billion, reported in the third quarter result. The cash was used to repay loansand our debt ratio is now 1.8 which is significantly better than the long-termtarget of below 2.5.A review of our long-term strategy was completed during the third quarter andresulted in four strategic priorities for the next five years Driveperformance, Drive profitable growth by creating customer value, Acceleratespeed in innovation and Expand our solutions business. As part of the strategicpriority on performance and to ensure long-term profitability we have introduceda cost reduction programme. Measures include purchasing savings, personnelreductions and efficiency improvements. The programme is expected to generatestructural savings of around SEK 600 million in 2021. In order to improve safetyand production stability we are setting new standards and implementing group-wide working practises.Sustainability is integrated into all parts of our strategy and we are proud tocontinue being named the most sustainable packaging company and one of the mostsustainable companies in the world as being included in the Dow JonesSustainability Index World.For the fourth quarter, the market for Division Board is expected to be stable,but we foresee a weaker market in some segments for Division Paper withincreased pricing pressure.BillerudKorsnäs has a strong position in relatively resilient product segments.Combined with our strong financial position and our strategic initiatives, thisgives me confidence that we are well equipped to meet an economic slowdown.

Nobia AB,2019-10-23 13:00:00,"Third quarter 2019  · Net sales for the third quarter amounted to SEK 3,265m (3,143).  · Organic growth was 3% (-5).  · Operating profit was unchanged at SEK 267m (267), corresponding to anoperating margin of 8.2% (8.5).  · Changes in exchange rates impacted operating profit negatively by SEK 15m.  · Profit after tax amounted to SEK 187m (201), corresponding to earnings pershare after dilution of SEK 1.11 (1.19).  · Operating cash flow amounted to SEK 346m (213).Soon I will already be two months into my new position as the President and CEOof Nobia. I have spent a lot of time visiting our various operations andlistening to and learning from colleagues. I am proud to join a financiallystrong company with a solid foundation built on the knowledge and ability of itsdedicated employees, strong brands and long-lasting trade partner relationships.For some time, the Group has been conducting a strategic review of areasincluding our manufacturing footprint, sourcing and how we go to market, todetermine how we can create more long-term value for all our stakeholders. Manypromising initiatives are being started and I will be able to share thesubstantial opportunities that we have to create value in due course.Nobia delivered a stable third quarter. Organic growth was an encouraging 3%with positive contributions from all three of our regions, despite uncertaintyand somewhat softer market conditions in some of the main markets. Operatingincome was in line with the previous year’s third quarter. The unfavourableimpact of the further weakening of the GBP against the EUR and higher directmaterial costs were compensated by higher average selling prices and afavourable customer mix development.The performance of Magnet in the UK and the consumer segment in Denmark wasespecially pleasing. Sales to project customers reported a volatile trendreflecting uncertainty in the property markets in Sweden, Norway and the UK. Inthe Netherlands, Bribus our most recent acquisition, continued to perform well.In the UK we are seeing the benefits of the re-positioning of Magnet to bothconsumers and trade customers. We have now adapted 160 stores to the improvedTrade concept, and this is reflected in the healthy organic sales developmentsin the quarter. The investment in the new positioning and the transition costsheld back profit which improved only marginally for the UK region.The political insecurity over Brexit continued to hamper demand and increaseduncertainty in the UK market. Even though it is difficult to predict the short-term consequences of a hard Brexit, Nobia has taken several actions to mitigaterisk, including building up its own safety stock, securing safety stock at keysuppliers and administrative actions to make import procedures as smooth aspossible.Jon SintornPresident and CEOFor further informationKristoffer Ljungfelt, CFO+46 8 440 16 00kristoffer.ljungfelt@nobia.comTobias Norrby, Head of Investor Relations+46 8 440 16 07tobias.norrby@nobia.com"

Driven by these operational improvements ouroperating loss was reduced by $15 million sequentially despite lower organicsales. The reduction came primarily through lower RD&E costs achieved throughprudent resource management and to a lesser extent by partnering in someengineering related activities in Active Safety. We were also successful inworking capital management, particularly in managing accounts receivables andinventories. We will continue to drive our improvement initiatives, includingpartnering and outsourcing opportunities, as we adapt to the market realities,and drive our own continued development.In September, we signed our seventh customer for our in-house developed visiontechnology. This shows that our core development combined with the softwaredeveloped in Zenuity delivers powerful solutions, creating leading ADAS andcollaborative driving functionality for the years to come. In addition, we arecurrently preparing to introduce our fourth-generation vision technology, aspart of a number of our customer launches in 2020 and into 2021.The automotive industry faced a volatile and challenging quarter, with lightvehicle production being weaker than anticipated in July across most of ourmajor markets. Veoneer saw a sharper sales decline than the overall market, aswe faced some model phase-outs of certain customer programs and a negativeproduct mix. In addition, positive effects on sales growth from launches of newcustomer programs are only anticipated to start in 2020.We see this challenging environment in our industry, to continue for some time.This relates both to an increased volatility in LVP forecasts as well ascustomer launch schedules and take rates, particularly in China, for productssold as optional features by the OEMs. Specifically, for Veoneer we areproactively managing the inherent risks that come from launching several newcustomer programs and technologies in a short time span in the quarters to come.For the next several quarters, our focus is on: successful customer launchesheading into 2020 and 2021, market adjustment initiatives to continue to driveefficiencies and improve cash flow, and to continue to win profitable newbusiness.Contacts:Thomas Jönsson - EVP Communications & IR, +46 8 527 762 27 orthomas.jonsson@veoneer.com andRay Pekar - VP Investor Relations, +1 248 794 4537 or ray.pekar@veoneer.com.Inquiries - Company Corporate website www.veoneer.com.This report is information that Veoneer, Inc. is obliged to make public pursuantto the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

During the first nine months of the year, salesincreased by 18.8 per cent to SEK 10,104 (8,502) million, driven byacquisitions, organic growth, and foreign exchange gains. The generallyfavourable economy was a strong contributing factor to organic growth.EBITA* increased by 25.0 per cent to SEK 1,872 (1,498) million during the nine-month period and the EBITA margin* improved by 0.9 of a percentage point to18.5 (17.6) per cent. The improvement in profitability was mainly due to organicgrowth and acquisitions. Earnings per share increased by 12.9% till SEK 11.76(10.42) during the first nine months of the year.All three business areas reported robust sales and earnings growth andperformance was stable in all divisions, except for Forest, for the nine-monthperiod. During the quarter, the Forest division made provisions of about SEK 15million for restructuring as a result of decreased sales and project setbacks.The market generally remained positive for the three business areas.Cash flow increased by 21.3 per cent to SEK 1,178 (971) million. Although cashflow improved compared with the year-earlier period, we can note that thegenerally favourable market situation resulted in higher accounts receivable andinventory build-up in many of our businesses. Cash flow was also negativelyimpacted by lower customer advances in the first nine months of the year, whichwas primarily related to fewer new projects in the Forest division.During the year, Lifco strengthened Demolition & Tools with the addition of twonew businesses. The companies consolidated were Swedish company IndexatorRotator Systems, a world-leading manufacturer of rotators, and the majority ofItalian company Hammer, a provider of hydraulic hammers and other demolitiontools for excavators. The Environmental Technology division in the SystemsSolutions business area has also been strengthened with two new businessesduring the year. We have acquired the majority of the German company Ergopack,which is the leading manufacturer of ergonomic and mobile pallet strappingsystems and the Norwegian company Rustibus Worldwide, which is a leadingsupplier of surface preparation tools and safety equipment for the marineindustry. We have also consolidated the majority of UK company UK POS in theService and Distribution division in the Systems Solutions business area. UK POSis a leading supplier of exhibition and visual display solutions. Theacquisitions jointly had a positive impact on Lifco’s results and financialposition during the nine-month period.Lifco has a solid financial position and interest-bearing net debt amounted to1.5 times EBITDA*, which is well in line with our target of interest-bearing netdebt of a maximum of three times EBITDA*. This means that Lifco has significantfinancial scope to make additional acquisitions, while we retain focus onincreasing earnings in our existing operations.Per WaldemarsonPresident and CEOGROUP PERFORMANCE IN JANUARY – SEPTEMBERSales increased by 18.8 per cent to SEK 10,104 (8,502) million, driven byacquisitions, organic growth, and foreign exchange gains.

EBITA* relative to average capital employedexcluding goodwill was at 165 per cent at year-end and declined to 122 per centduring the first nine months of the year. The return on capital employed wasnegatively impacted by lower advance payments from customers compared with thesame period in 2018. The implementation of IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019 also hada negative impact on the return since right-of-use assets are included incapital employed.The Group’s net debt increased by SEK 1,996 million from 31 December 2018 to SEK5,681 million at 30 September 2019, of which liabilities related to call/putoptions and additional considerations for acquisitions amounted to SEK 861 (574)million.

Cash flow was negatively affected by higher inventory build-up as wellas lower customer advances in the Forest division. Cash flow from investingactivities was SEK -1,555 (-580) million, which was mainly attributable toacquisitions.GROUP PERFORMANCE IN THE THIRD QUARTERSales increased by 15.2 per cent to SEK 3,211 (2,787) million in the thirdquarter, driven by acquisitions, organic growth, and foreign exchange gains.Acquisitions contributed 7.6 per cent, organic growth was 4.9 per cent, whilechanges in exchange rates had a positive impact of 2.7 per cent.EBITA* increased by 14.6 per cent to SEK 596 (520) million and the EBITA margin*decreased by 0.1 percentage points to 18.6 (18.7) per cent.

Lifco is also exposed to financial risks, including currency risks,interest rate risks, credit and counterparty risks.The Parent Company is affected by the above risks and uncertainties in itscapacity as owner of the subsidiary companies. For further information onLifco’s risks and risk management, see the 2018 Annual Report.Accounting policiesThe Group’s interim report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 InterimFinancial Reporting and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. In respect of theParent Company, the report has been prepared in accordance with the AnnualAccounts Act and Recommendation RFR 2 Financial Reporting for Legal Entities ofthe Swedish Financial Reporting Board. The accounting policies have been appliedin accordance with those which are presented in the 2018 Annual Report andshould be read in conjunction with these.The Group applies IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019, and the implementation of thestandard means that nearly all leases are recognised in the balance sheet of thelessee, as there is no longer any distinction made between operating and financeleases. According to IFRS 16, a tangible asset (the right to use a leased asset)and a financial liability (non-current and current) regarding the obligation topay lease payments is to be recognised in the balance sheet. In the consolidatedincome statement, depreciation and interest expense are recognised instead ofoperating leases, which were recognised in their entirety within operatingprofit. IFRS 16 impacts the cash flow insofar that leasing payments impact thecash flow from operating activities (e.g. interest and low-value and short-termleases) and cash flow from financing activities (repayment of the leaseliability). The Group applies the modified retrospective approach, which entailsthat right-of-use assets are measured at an amount corresponding to the leaseliability on 1 January 2019 (adjusted for prepaid and accrued lease payments).Accordingly, the transition to IFRS 16 has no impact on the Group’s equity.Since the modified retrospective approach was applied, comparative figures for2018 were not recalculated. The Group has chosen to apply the exception and thusnot to recognise short-term leases and low-value leases as a part of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability in the balance sheet. Paymentsattributable to these leases are instead recognised as a cost straight line overthe term of the lease. The remaining lease commitments essentially comprisepremises such as office, warehouse and factory premises.Reconciliation ofobligations foroperating leases andrecognised leaseliability (SEK million)Obligations for            600operating leases 31December 2018Discount effect            -69Less: short-term leases    -67and low-value leasesLess:                      -19corrections/reclassificationsTranslation differences    -5Lease liability            440recognised 1 January2019The weighted average incremental borrowing rate used to calculate the discounteffect is 2.09 per cent.

Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on thisinterim report based on our review.Scope of ReviewWe conducted our review in accordance with the International Standard on ReviewEngagements ISRE 2410, Review of Interim Report Performed by the IndependentAuditor of the Entity. A review consists of making inquiries, primarily ofpersons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applyinganalytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scopethan an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing,ISA, and other generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden.

Lifco considers that this is a useful                               additional KPI which allows users of the                               financial reports to assess the Group’s ability                               to pay dividends, make strategic investments and                               meet its financial obligations. Lifco defines                               the KPI as follows: current and non-current                               liabilities to credit institutions, bonds as                               well as interest-bearing pension provisions less                               cash and cash equivalents.Equity/assets ratio            Equity divided by total assets (balance sheet                               total).Capital employed               Capital employed is a measure which Lifco uses                               for calculating the return on capital employed                               and for measuring how efficient the Group is.                               Lifco considers that capital employed is useful                               in helping users of the financial reports to                               understand how the Group finances itself. Lifco                               defines capital employed as total assets less                               cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing                               pension provisions and non- interest-bearing                               liabilities with the exception of liabilities                               related to call/put options and additional                               considerations relating to acquisitions,                               calculated as the average of the last four                               quarters.Capital employed excluding     Capital employed excluding goodwill and othergoodwill and other             intangible assets is a measure which Lifco usesintangible assets              for calculating the return on capital employed                               and for measuring how efficient the Group is.                               Lifco considers that capital employed excluding                               goodwill and other intangible assets is useful                               in helping users of the financial reports to                               understand the impact of goodwill and other                               intangible assets on that capital which requires                               a return. Lifco defines capital employed                               excluding goodwill and other intangible assets                               as total assets less cash and cash equivalents,                               interest-bearing pension provisions, non                               -interest-bearing liabilities with the exception                               of liabilities related to call/put options and                               additional considerations relating to                               acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible                               assets, calculated as the average of the last                               four quarters.RECONCILIATION OF ALTERNATIVE KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORSThe interim report presents alternative key performance indicators for assessingthe Group’s performance.

Midsona AB,2019-10-23 08:00:00,"Acquisition-intensive quarter with strong underlying growthJuly–September 2019 (third quarter)  · Net sales amounted to SEK 765 million (773), of which the concluded Alprosales   assignment was SEK 2 million (71).  · Growth for the prioritized brands was 11.7 percent.  · EBITDA amounted to SEK 77 million (68) before items affecting comparability,corresponding to a margin of 10.1 percent (8.8).  · Profit for the period was SEK 35 million (32), corresponding to earnings pershare of SEK 0.77 (0.70) before and after dilution.  · Free cash flow amounted to SEK 19 million (96).  · Midsona acquired Eisblümerl Naturkost GmbH in Germany and Ekko Gourmet AB inSweden.  · Midsona entered an agreement to acquire Alimentation Santé SAS, with aleading position in organic and plant-based food in France and Spain.January–September 2019 (nine months)  · Net sales amounted to SEK 2,256 million (2,097).  · EBITDA amounted to SEK 209 million (182) before items affectingcomparability, corresponding to a margin of 9.3 percent (8.7).  · Profit for the period was SEK 62 million (96), corresponding to earnings pershare of SEK 1.35 (2.09) before and after dilution.  · Free cash flow amounted to SEK 52 million (132).Significant events following the end of the report period  · Midsona took possession of the acquisition of Alimentation Santé SAS on 1October.  · The Board of Directors of Midsona decided on a new share issue withpreferential rights for existing shareholders of around SEK 600 million.  · Midsona acquired 51 percent of Paradiset EMV AB, a collaborative arrangementtogether with the food chain Paradiset.Comment by the CEO A strong quarter in terms of earningsIn the third quarter, Midsona took market shares and sales for our eightprioritised brands increased by a solid 12 percent. The sales for the Group as awhole continued, however, to be impacted negatively by the concludeddistribution assignment for Alpro. In total, it yielded more or less unchangedsales (–1 percent). In addition to this, there was a raw material shortage ofpeanuts and almonds, which mainly affected the German market and the newlyacquired Eisblümerl. In terms of earnings, we had a strong quarter, despitecontinued headwind from the exchange rate trend. This was mainly attributable tothe strong sales growth for our prioritised brands, furthermore our Nordic cost-savings programme began to provide results.Strong growth for our prioritised brandsBy focusing our resources on our strongest brands, we feel that we have the bestconditions to reach our financial targets in the long term and, during thequarter, it was pleasing to see our market investments having an effect. Salesfor our eight prioritised brands increased sequentially during the year, from agrowth of 6 percent in the first quarter and 10 percent in the second quarter to12 percent in the third quarter. Friggs continued to perform the best, but ourorganic brands also made strong contributions and improved growth from therestrained first six months.Focus on acquisitions and integrationThe third quarter was very intensive in terms of acquisitions and was dominatedby the acquisition of Alimentation Santé, a leading actor in organic and plant-based food in France and Spain. The acquisition constitutes a strategicallyimportant platform for our continued European expansion at the same time that itstrengthens our position in organic and plant-based food. We see majordevelopment opportunities, mainly in plant-based meat alternatives, and throughthis acquisition, we have gained access to production capacity for this, whichwe also intend to use in other parts of the Group. The acquisition was announcedat the beginning of the quarter and concluded after the end of the quarter on 1October 2019. An intensive integration effort has thereafter begun.At the beginning of the quarter, Eisblümerl, one of Germany’s leading producersof organic nut, nougat and chocolate spreads, was also acquired. It is pleasingthat we have already seen a good return for Eisblümerl in the existing structurein Davert. These companies are good examples of our strategy: an initialplatform acquisition (Davert) that is then supplemented with an add-onacquisition (Eisblümerl).The same logic applies to the acquisition of the Swedish company Ekko Gourmet,announced at the beginning of the quarter. Ekko Gourmet is specialised onorganic and vegan food and can use Midsona’s strong distribution network. Theintegration has gone well, and the acquisition has also developed well in itsnew environment.Upcoming integration work and impending new share issueOverall, we are pleased about the underlying sales trend for our prioritisedbrands during the quarter and also about our Nordic cost-savings programmebeginning to yield results. However, we still have the largest effects of theprogramme ahead of us, which bodes well for upcoming quarters. During thequarter, we devoted a lot of time to concluding the acquisitions we recentlypresented, and, in the current quarter, we expect considerable focus to be onintegrating them into the Midsona Group.The extensive confidence that many existing shareholders have shown for ourimpending new share issue, which is being done to finance the acquisition ofAlimentation Santé, is also pleasing. A new long-term financing agreement thatprovides conditions for continued growth was also announced during the quarter.We will continuously work further to find new platform and add-on acquisitions.Through the acquisitions made to-date, we have earnestly committed toconsolidating the fragmented European market for products in health and well-being. I am confidently and inquisitively looking forward to our excitingfuture and would like to take this opportunity to thank colleagues, Boardmembers and shareholders for their strong confidence in Midsona.Peter ÅsbergPresident and CEOThis is information of the type that Midsona AB is obligated to make public inaccordance with the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

Inwido AB,2019-10-23 07:45:00,"This information is such that Inwido AB (publ) is obliged to publish inaccordance with the EU market abuse regulation. The information was submitted bythe below contact persons for publication on 23 October 2019 at 7:45 a.m. CET.Strong cash flow and continued favourable growth in e-commerceThird quarter of 2019  · Net sales amounted to SEK 1,665 million (1,682), representing a decrease of1 percent. Organic growth was a negative 2 percent.  · EBITA amounted to SEK 203 million and the EBITA margin increased to12.2 percent.

Excluding IFRS 16, operating EBITA amounted to SEK 200 million(202) and the operating EBITA margin unchanged at 12.0 percent.  · Earnings per share rose to SEK 2.56 (2.31).January-September 2019  · Net sales rose slightly to SEK 4,818 million (4,802), an increase of lessthan 1 percent. Organic growth was a negative 3 percent.  · EBITA increased to SEK 435 million and the EBITA margin increased to9.0 percent. Excluding IFRS 16, EBITA increased to SEK 426 million (420) and theEBITA margin rose to 8.8 percent (8.7).  · Operating EBITA amounted to SEK 435 million and the operating EBITA marginwas 9.0 percent. Excluding IFRS 16, operating EBITA amounted to SEK 426 million(442) and the operating EBITA margin was 8.8 percent (9.2).  · Earnings per share rose to SEK 5.20 (5.16).The CEO comments:""For the third quarter of 2019, we delivered improved earnings, while strongcash flow brought net debt down to 2.5x EBITDA, excluding IFRS 16. Thisdevelopment, with improved earnings despite challenging markets, testifies tothe strength of our new governance model, Simplify. Compared with thecorresponding period in the preceding year, net sales decreased by 1 percent inthe third quarter to SEK 1,665 million (1,682).Despite the lower sales, we increased our profitability, mainly thanks to earlycost saving initiatives and a more advantageous mix overall, with a higherproportion of consumer sales compared with the preceding year. Our assessment isalso that we are, on the whole, continuing to capture market shares in theNordic market.Continued positive development in South, stabilization in NorthBusiness area South continued to develop positively during the quarter, withstrong development among the companies in the area. Business area South’s salesincreased by 7 percent and its operating EBITA rose to SEK 135 million (118),meaning that the operating EBITA margin rose to 18.7 percent (17.5). Among ourlarger Danish operations, development remains strong, confirming that Inwido’sleadership, combined with independent local companies, can gradually develop andrefine the operations. The positive trend in e-Commerce continued, with organicsales growth of 8 percent and maintained profitability, and today 10 percent ofconsolidated sales derive from e-Commerce. This is encouraging proof that ourefforts in e-Commerce produce results too.Business area North developed more weakly. In Sweden and Finland, the industrymarket remains challenging, with decreased new construction, although the trendin the consumer segment, which is of importance to Inwido, appears relativelystable. It is gratifying to note how our new governance model, Simplify, hasserved the development of the Norwegian operations, which continued to developstrongly during the quarter. While developing our companies, we also haveefficiency improvements and cost savings continuously in progress to counteractvolume losses. Sales for the third quarter decreased by 7 percent, whileoperating EBITA decreased to SEK 72 million (91), meaning that the operatingEBITA margin landed at 8 percent (9.4).Strong cash flow and reduced debtInwido’s guiding principles are to acquire and develop Europe’s best companiesin windows and doors. Our long-term acquisition strategy stands firm and ourefforts are continuing to further strengthen the balance sheet to be able tomake acquisitions. The third quarter has encouraged us in these efforts. Duringthe period, operating cash flow was positive in the amount of SEK 319 million,compared with SEK 149 million in the corresponding period in the preceding year,meaning that the net debt/EBITDA ratio at the end of the quarter fell to theGroup’s target of 2.5, excluding IFRS 16, compared with 3.0 twelve monthsearlier.Future prospectsWith a strong earnings and cash flow, as well as being backed up by 28companies, we enter the fourth quarter with both confidence and humility. TheNordic industrial market remains challenging, and assessing the consumer marketsis difficult. Every day, we work hard to streamline and develop companies ingeographies with more challenging market conditions while, at the same time,refining the companies in the more favourable markets and continuing to investfor growth in e-commerce. We do all of this to be able to satisfy the underlyinginvestment needs of both the new construction and renovation markets.By demonstrating our resilience in harsher periods, with stable margins and acapacity for developing our companies, we consider ourselves well-positioned totackle the conditions with which the markets and our customers will present usand our companies in the future.""MALMÖ, 23 OCTOBER 2019Henrik HjalmarssonPresident and CEORead the full report in the pdf attachedFor more information, please contact:Henrik Hjalmarsson, President and CEO Tel.: 46 (0)76 846 20 46Peter Welin, CFO and deputy CEO Tel.: 46 (0)703 24 31 90E-mail: peter.welin@inwido.comAbout InwidoInwido owns and develops companies that improve people’s everyday lives indoorswith various products and services.

SSAB AB,2019-10-23 07:30:00,"The third quarter  · Sales were SEK 18,840 (19,038) million  · Operating profit before depreciation/amortization excluding items affectingcomparability was SEK 1,327 (2,563) million  · Operating profit, excluding items affecting comparability, was SEK 300(1,600) million  · Operating profit, including items affecting comparability, was SEK 150(1,387) million  · Earnings per share were SEK 0.03 (0.85)  · Operating cash flow was SEK 1,038 (1,922) million  · Net debt/equity ratio was 15% (17%), excluding IFRS 16Comments by the CEOSSAB’s operating profit, excluding items affecting comparability, for the thirdquarter of 2019 was SEK 300 million, down SEK 1,300 million compared with thethird quarter of 2018. Lower earnings were primarily attributable to SSABEurope. Group operating cash flow for the third quarter was SEK 1,038 (1,922)million.Demand for SSAB Special Steels weakened during the third quarter, primarily inEurope. Shipments were down and operating profit was lower than the same quarterprior year at SEK 358 (536) million. Margins declined during the quarter mainlydue to higher iron ore costs.Demand in Europe was seasonally lower and weaker business conditions meant thatthe decline was more pronounced than normal. Operating profit for the thirdquarter fell to SEK -480 (460) million. Exceptional pressure on margins on theEuropean market continued to have a negative impact on third quarter earnings,which were also negatively impacted by the planned mid-term repair of one of theblast furnaces in Raahe. Market prices of iron ore decreased during the latterpart of the quarter and will lead to lower raw material costs for SSAB Europeduring the fourth quarter.Third quarter operating profit for SSAB Americas decreased to SEK 522 (790)million, primarily due to lower realized prices. Demand was relatively stableand shipments were up somewhat compared with the previous quarter.Heading towards the end of the year, we see a more pronounced seasonal slowdownthan normal. Several measures were taken already in the third quarter to cutcosts across the Group production rates were reduced on several lines and thesmaller blast furnace in Oxelösund was idled, there was a significant reductionof temporary employees, reduced working hours and temporary lay-offs wereintroduced together with other costs savings measures. To achieve furtherreductions of cost and capacity, we will idle one of the blast furnaces in Raaheat the end of November. At the same time, our strong balance sheet, low netgearing and limited debt maturities the coming years give us a sound basis tocontinue to develop SSAB. The HYBRIT initiative, aiming to produce fossil freesteel, is proceeding according to plan and is generating a lot of interest amongour customers.Invitation to SSAB’s third quarter 2019 results briefingSSAB invites you to a presentation of the quarterly report today at 9.30am CEST.The interim report for the third quarter of 2019 will be presented by SSAB’sPresident and CEO Martin Lindqvist, and CFO Håkan Folin.

In connection with this, the company signed a new bank loan of SEK 250million over 3 years.Comments from Jan Häglund, President and CEOEnea’s third quarter 2019 was a period of revenue and earnings growth. Thestrong growth by Network Solutions (revenue 38 percent higher than the samequarter last year) was particularly positive. Our latest acquisition, of abusiness unit developing policy and access control software, has progressedbetter than initial estimates. Even excluding this latest acquisition, NetworkSolutions grew organically by 6 percent, mainly from new customers and businessin traffic management and cyber security.Our dependence on Operating System Solutions continues to decrease. This productgroup contributed 23 percent of total turnover in the quarter, compared to 29percent in the same period last year. Operating System Solutions’ revenues weredown 7 percent, a trend we expect to continue. The contract signed in July 2019on one of our key accounts gives us predictable revenues over a four-yearperiod. We foresee continued solid profitability in this segment and we’ll keeprealizing efficiencies and adapting our operations to customer needs andbusiness volumes.The Global Services unit, where we mainly help customers on advanced softwaredevelopment through our competence centers in Romania and the US, returnedgrowth (7 percent) and improved profitability. Global Services contributed 15percent of total turnover in the third quarter.Direct sales of Policy and Access SolutionsPrior to the quarter, the acquired policy and access control unit operatedthrough indirect sales via major system suppliers only. In July, we signed acontract with a major German operator, involving direct delivery of softwareproducts to this customer’s cloud infrastructure. Our business model is acombination of software licenses, a multi-year support contract and installationand upgrade services. This new contract shows that we have the ability to sellpolicy and access solutions direct to operators, which complements our indirectsales model and gives us valuable contacts with more customers.Optimization of video trafficDuring August, we signed a large traffic management contract with an existingcustomer in South East Asia. This region is very exciting – traffic in mobilenetworks is growing fast, investment needs are increasing while subscribersdemand that video services and social media work without delays andinterruptions. Our traffic management solutions will reduce cost for ourcustomer and improve the end-user experience for subscribers. We foreseecontinued positive development of the traffic management market as mobilesubscribers across the world increase their requirements on performance andservices in 4G and 5G networks.Enea has a strong position on the traffic management market and our softwareruns in commercial networks across the world together with equipment from mostof the major system providers. During the quarter, we have suffered from changesand delays in certain operator projects involving Huawei, which has resulted inlower revenues than forecasted. We expect these disturbances to continue, but wedo not judge that this creates long-term risks for our market position.Great interest for Enea’s virtualization platformWe’re seeing growing interest in our new platform for virtualizing small networkunits, deployed close to end-users (NFV Access). One of our first customers isCMC Networks, an enterprise operator in Africa and the Middle East. CMC Networkswill use our software in its new enterprise communication solution, known as SDWAN. Our revenues increase with units in operation, from very limited levels in2019. Alongside Intel and FlexiWAN, we recently demonstrated how open sourceapplications can cut our customers’ costs and increase their choice. We seegrowth potential in this segment, although the enterprise market for small-sizeunit virtualization is at an early stage.More efficient capital structureDuring August, we successfully completed a private placement to alter Enea’scapital structure. The bond loan of SEK 500 million issued in 2018 was redeemedin advance in October 2019, reducing Enea’s cost of capital. These changes willhave a net positive effect on the company’s earnings per share from 2020. Withinour new capital structure, there’s also scope to raise additional credit, whichwe may need for future acquisitions.Future prospectsWe have a positive view of the market for software in telecommunication andenterprise networks, although large contracts can create variations in financialresults between individual quarters. We’re investing in product development andinnovation organic growth, while continuing to screen acquisition targets thatcan strengthen our market positioning and long-term earnings capacity.Our goal for the full year 2019 is to achieve revenue growth on 2018, and anoperating margin of over 20 percentThe full report can be found as an attachment in this press release andpublished on www.enea.comPress and analyst meetingPress and financial analysts are invited to a press and analyst meeting whereJan Häglund, President and CEO, will present and comment on the report.Time: Wednesday October 23 at 08:30 am CET.Link to Audiocast: https://financialhearings.com/event/11502Phone number:SE: +46 8 505 58353UK: +44 333 3009262US: +1 833 526 8381This information is information that Enea AB (publ) is obliged to make publicpursuant to the EU Market buse Regulation.

Kungsleden AB,2019-10-23 07:00:00,"•    Profit from property management increased by 8 per cent to SEK 889 million(821). The increase was due to higher rental revenue and operating net in like-for-like portfolio terms, with 5 and 6 per cent respectively, and improved netfinancial items.•    New leasing amounted to SEK 142 million (167), and net leasing for theperiod was SEK 21 million (27).•    Changes in value on properties amounted to SEK 1,260 million (1,291). Thevalue increase is mainly a result of a higher operating net and slightly reducedrequired valuation yield.•    Property value at the end of the period was SEK 36,833 million (SEK 34,697million at the beginning of the year).•    Net profit after tax for the period was SEK 1,475 million (1,662), or SEK6.75 per share (7.61).•    Current NAV increased to SEK 85.67 per share (77.05).Important events during and after the quarter•    Occupancy rate of 54 per cent was achieved in Kungsleden’s new developmentproject in Malmö – Eden by Kungsleden. This project has 8,000 sq.m. of offices,with tenants scheduled to move in during spring 2021.•    Several lease contracts were signed at Finnslätten in Västerås, on a totalof approximately 5,300 sq.m. Tenants signing include battery manufacturerNorthvolt and biotechnology company Scandinavian Gene Synthesis (SGS DNA).•    Kungsleden refinanced loans with a total of SEK 1 .7 billion in the thirdquarter by arranging a 10-year mortgage loan. After re-financing, Kungsleden hasno bank loans maturing prior to 2023.CEO statement“Kungsleden has worked consistently to improve the quality of its propertyportfolio by divesting properties outside its priority markets. While in theshort term, this does mean a lower operating net and profit from propertymanagement, as in the third quarter, we are convinced that our commitment tomodern, high-quality properties helps reduce risk, and promote long-term rentalgrowth, as well as value growth potential.All our main markets – Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö and Västerås, where close to90 per cent of our property portfolio is located – have well-diversifiedeconomies with continued population growth. These metropolitan regions alsogenerate over 62 per cent of Sweden’s GDP. In my view, they’re strong enoughgrowth engines and will fare better than many other locations in a poorereconomic cycle. A recent report from Oxford Economics forecasts GDP growth inthe Stockholm region - where we have nearly 50 per cent of our portfolio - atabout 2 per cent in 2019, and down only marginally in 2020. This is asignificantly higher growth than leading forecasters anticipate for the countryas a whole. Against the above background, we do not anticipate any slowdown indemand for commercial premises on our main markets.Leasing activity was also high in the quarter, with a lot of new lease contractsbeing signed, equivalent to rent volume of SEK 49 million (37). Total leasingfor the first nine months of the year is SEK 142 million (167). We also stillhave a strong new leasing pipeline, including great interest in Finnslätten inVästerås, a location offering genuine potential. We’re collaborating with ABB,the City of Västerås and other major companies here to create an attractiveplace with a broad offering of services capable of bringing in more innovativebusinesses, talented people, plus research and development.2019 looks like being a good year for Kungsleden.

Beijer Ref AB,2019-10-22 08:30:00,"Growth despite lower prices for refrigerantsNet sales increased by 9,6% in the third quarter compared to the same periodlast year and amounted to SEK 3,953 million (3,607). Organic growth was 5.2%.The operating profit for the quarter amounted to SEK 358 million (339), anincrease of 5.5% compared with the same period last year. The operating marginwas 9.1% (9.4%), of which 0.2% is a positive IFRS 16 effect.Profit for the period totalled SEK 256 million (240). Profit per share amountedto SEK 2.00 (1.88).The company's liquidity is good and unutilised credit amounts to SEK 1,453million (589).With effect from 1 January 2019, the company applies IFRS 16 with regard to thegroup's leasing agreements and all figures for 2019 include this change. Theconversion had a positive effect of SEK 7 million on operating profit and of SEK0.5 million on net profit.Comments by the CEOSustainable growthDuring the third quarter, the group's sales and profit increased compared withthe same period the previous year. Net sales amounted to SEK 3,953 million (SEK3,607 million), which is an increase of 9.6%, of which 5.2% is organic. Theincrease in sales is mainly due to increased sales of HVAC and OEM.Operating profit during the quarter amounted to SEK 358 million (SEK 339million) and the operating margin was 9.1% (9.4%). The margin is slightly lowerthan the previous year. The main reason is a continuing downward price trend forrefrigerants. Our assessment has always been that the price level will becomestabilised, something that we have not yet seen. In the long run, the phasing-out programme under the European F-gas regulation, which runs until 2030,should mean a price increase for refrigerants. There are also tougher measuresto prevent the illegal trade in refrigerants, something about which we take apositive view. The percentage of refrigerants in total sales is falling and isexpected to continue to decrease.Of the group's other product segments, corresponding to approximately 90% of thetotal business, sales in HVAC now account for 38% (34%) of the company'sturnover. The company's OEM product range also continues to increase its shareof sales and now accounts for approximately 10% (9%). To be able to satisfy themarket's growing demand for environmentally friendly refrigeration technology,Beijer Ref has decided to invest in a new production facility for OEMmanufacturing in Padua, Italy.  As well as production and storage, the buildingwill accommodate offices and a training and development centre for naturalrefrigerants. The facility is expected to be ready by the end of 2020. We willalso invest in a production line to handle natural, environmentally friendlyrefrigerants such as CO2 and propane at the company's filling unit inGothenburg.All regions except the Nordic region show growth in both sales and profit. If welook at our geographical regions, the outcome is affected to some extent byseasonal variations. It is gratifying that both Asia Pacific and Africa areshowing profit improvements. In Asia Pacific, we have also implemented a numberof measures that have contributed to both sales growth and better margins. InAfrica, we have received new orders for green, environmentally friendlytechnology.The market's interest in our environmentally friendly refrigeration technologycontinues to increase, for which reason we are educating customers, suppliersand our own personnel in handling natural refrigerants. Our training conceptBeijer Ref Academy, which is concentrating on exactly this, is highlyappreciated. Our first academy was inaugurated about a year ago in Italy. Now wehave established further academies in France and China and more are in thepipeline.Beijer Ref has grown to be active today in 36 countries. Although the companieswork independently, we also work as a group with common basic values andcentralised projects. To contribute to development and increase knowledge, wehave launched the Beijer Ref Exchange Programme during the quarter. Employeesfrom different parts of Beijer Ref have the opportunity to try a new job atanother company within the group. I am convinced that this type of activitystrengthens us as a group and helps to increase motivation and team spirit andprovides us with new insights.My assessment is that we have good opportunities for continued growth, despiteuncertain external factors. Acquisitions are an important part of the strategyand are evaluated continuously. The company's liquidity is good and the grouphas a strong cash flow, which means that we have the capacity to perform furtheracquisitions. Overall, we have coped very well with the conditions prevailing inthe market. Our strategy is firmly anchored within the company, which puts us ina strong position for the future.Per Bertland, CEOThird quarter of 2019NET SALESBeijer Ref increased its net sales by 9.6 per cent to SEK 3,953 million (3,607)in the third quarter of 2019, 1.7% of which is explained by the acquisitionsmade in 2018. Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organicgrowth in net sales was 5.2 per cent. All regions except the Nordics show salesgrowth. Commercial refrigeration represents 52% (57%) of the company's sales,38% (34%) is HVAC and OEM accounts for 10% (9%) of total sales. The latter twoshow organic growth of 18% and 14% respectively during the quarter. Refrigerantscontinue to decrease and represent 12% (14%) of total sales.A weakened Swedish krona resulted in positive currency effects of SEK 91 million(195), corresponding to 2.7% (8.8%), since most of the company’s sales are incurrencies other than Swedish kronor.PROFITThe group’s operating profit totalled SEK 358 million (339) during the thirdquarter, an increase of 5.5 per cent. The operating margin was 9.1% (9.4%), forwhich the main explanation is lower prices for refrigerants. Adjusted for IFRS16 effects, the company's net financial items are in principle unchangedcompared with the previous year despite increased borrowing.The pre-tax profit was SEK 344 million (331). Profit for the period was SEK 256million (240). Profit per share amounted to SEK 2.00 (1.88).CASH FLOWCash flow from current operations before changes in working capital amounted toSEK 371 million in 2019, compared with SEK 390 million in 2018. Operating profitis higher in the quarter, but non-cash items increased by SEK 76 million inrespect of depreciation of usage rights assets due to the transition to IFRS 16.Taxes paid during the quarter are higher, which explains the decrease.Working capital decreased by SEK 212 million during the quarter compared with anincrease of SEK 198 million the previous year. This gives a positive cash flowfrom operating activities of SEK 583 million, compared with SEK 191 million theprevious year. The change in working capital between the years is mainlyexplained by a lower build-up of stocks.At the end of the period, the group had unutilised credit facilities totallingSEK 1,453 million (589).INVESTMENTSThe group’s investments in fixed assets including business combinations totalledSEK 36 million (36) during the quarter and refer primarily to investments infixed assets.COMPANY ACQUISITIONSThe group has made a minor supplementary acquisition during the quarter of theremaining shares (40%) in AC & Ref Parts CQ Patton Pty Ltd in Australia and nowowns 100% of the company. The company has annual sales of approximately SEK 25million through two sales branches. The company is included in its entirety inthe consolidated accounts with effect from 1 July 2019.SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER THE QUARTERBeijer Ref has taken a decision and received planning permission to invest in anew factory for green refrigeration technology so as to be able to satisfymarket demand for refrigeration units based on natural refrigerants.

The companydevelops refrigeration units that are based on the environmentally friendlyrefrigerant CO2. SCM Frigo is one of the global leaders in the market. Demandfor environmentally friendly refrigeration units is driven by the European F-gasregulation and a general green trend. The regulation means that F-gases, whichare the most important refrigerants for industrial and commercial cooling, mustbe reduced by 80% by 2030. Construction begins in the autumn of 2019 and theplant will be completed at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. The investmentis estimated to amount to approximately 10 million euros.

CDON is in its final phase of completing its transition to amarketplace and has proven the attractiveness of this business model. Nellyshowed continued growth but lower margins in a challenging market.Qliro preparing for listing at Nasdaq StockholmThe subsidiary Qliro (formerly called Qliro Financial Services) increased itsloan book by 49 percent in the quarter to just under SEK 1.9 billion, whereofpersonal loans amounted to SEK 653 million at the end of the quarter. Totaloperating income rose by 12 percent to SEK 86 million, and operating incomebefore depreciation, amortization and impairment rose 85 percent to SEK 19million.Qliro Group has initiated the process to list the subsidiary Qliro on NasdaqStockholm’s main market in the first half of 2020. The company has grown rapidlyover the last few years. The Board of Directors of Qliro Group believes that astock exchange listing gives Qliro the best platform to take advantage of futureopportunities for growth and value creation as well as access to the capitalmarkets.CDON’s transformation soon completedCDON (formerly called CDON Marketplace) has now reached the final stage of itstransition into a marketplace for external merchants, complemented with salesfrom own inventory. External merchant sales increased by as much as 66 percentand the total gross merchandise value of the marketplace grew again during thequarter. Commission income increased by 39 percent, which helped boost the grossmargin by as much as 5.1 percentage points to 19.9 percent. Employee costsdecreased significantly as the company makes efficiency improvements followinginvestments in technology and automation.The transition to the marketplace model, has had a negative effect on net salesbut a positive effect on profitability and capital tied up in the company. Dueto a successful transition, CDON has reached an operating profit beforedepreciation of SEK 2.3 (-5.9) million in the quarter and SEK 11 (-29) millionover the last 12 months. This shows that CDON’s marketplace model is scalableand profitable.Nelly grows in a weak marketNelly increased its sales by 7 percent in a generally weak market that wascharacterized by much campaign activity. Consequently, Nelly increased itsmarketing spend by SEK 5 million. Some major campaigns were launched, which arealso being planned for the rest of the year. Earnings were also negativelyimpacted by a non-recurring effect of SEK 5 million (costs for departing CFO anda settlement with PostNord). Gross profit amounted to SEK 76 million andoperating profit before depreciation, amortization and impairment decreased toSEK 5 (24) million.Nelly intends to move its warehouse from Falkenberg to Borås in 2021.

In both companies, value-creating activities are underway that willimprove conditions for growth and profitability. When Qliro is listed, QliroGroup intends to change its name to better reflect its future business.Qliro Group has gone from actively developing many businesses to owning threeindependent companies.

Rottneros AB,2019-10-22 08:00:00,"Strong deliveries in  a weakening market  ·  NET TURNOVER for the third quarter 2019 increased by 9 % to 618 (567) MSEK.The delivery volume is higher, while sales prices have fallen. The pulp pricehedges, which are included in turnover, gave a positive result in the quarter.  · PROFIT AFTER FINANCIAL ITEMS for the third quarter decreased by 54 % to 49(106) MSEK. Earnings per share for the quarter decreased by 54 % to SEK 0,25(0,54).  · NBSK LIST PRICE continued its downward trend during the quarter. Comparedwith third quarter 2018 the price in USD was 26 % lower in USD and 20 % lower ini SEK.  · THE PRODUCTION VOLUME for the quarter was 100,3 (100,0) thousand tons. Thesales volume was 110,8 (92,5) thousand tons, which is a new quarterly record.  · THE AVAILABILITY OF PULP WOOD has been good, while the cost for rawmaterials and other variable costs have been higher than in 2018.  · CASH FLOW during the year has been strong.Net debt as of September 2019 was17 MSEK.  · THE BOARD PROPOSES AN EXTRA DIVIDEND of 0,70 SEK/share. An extra generalmeeting will be held on 4 November 2019.COMMENTS FROM THE CEODuring the third quarter, the Group was characterized by a stable production andhigh delivery rates compared with the corresponding quarter last year. Lowerpulp prices and continued high wood costs meant that EBIT earnings fell justover 50 percent to 54 MSEK. Cash flow was still good, which combined with asolid balance sheet means that there is room for an extra dividend. The focus oncontinuous improvements in both production and sustainability continues.Production was stable compared to Q3 last year and amounted to 100 thousandtons. During the quarter, the volume was affected by the annual maintenanceshutdown at Rottneros Mill, which went according to plan. In Vallvik, theproduction pace slowed somewhat towards the end of September, ahead of theplanned maintenance shutdown during October. Overall, the mills’ productionfollowed our long-term ambition to gradually increase availability. The EBIT forthe quarter, 54 MSEK, meant that the EBIT margin fell to 8,8 percent from lastyear’s 19,6. The quarter’s results were mainly impacted by the lower pulp pricesand continued high prices for wood and other input goods. At the same time,exchange rates and good delivery volumes were positive factors. Sales volumeincreased 20 percent to almost 111 thousand tons, which is a new quarterlyrecord. The supply of pulp wood remains good, and the balance between local woodsupply and imports is at a favorable and long-term sustainable level.During the quarter, we began preparations for an extra dividend of 0,70 SEK pershare, according to the Board’s proposal. Final decision will be made at anExtra General Meeting on November 4.KEY RECRUITMENTS IN PLACEWe completed two key recruitments during the quarter through the employment ofOla Thomasson as Mill Director for Rottneros Mill and Peter Sävelin as MillDirector for Vallvik Mill. I am very pleased to welcome both Ola and Peter tothe group management. Their solid experience as leaders and successful careersin the pulp and paper industry are key for taking our mills to the next level.PRICE PRESSURE REMAINED BUT SIGNS OF THE MARKET BOTTOMING OUTPulp prices continued to be squeezed in the third quarter by the short-termdeteriorating market balance. The gross price for NBSK fell from approximatelyUSD 1 000 at the beginning of the quarter to just over USD 800 by midOctober. This is the result of a lower consumption growth due to the slowdown inthe world economy, and China that has been affected by increased trade barriers.At the same time, the supply in the market has increased through high capacityutilization in the pulp industry worldwide and new production volumes fromseveral Nordic players during the year. However, a slightly improved stockbalance and some announcements about price increases in Asia indicate that thetrend is leveling out. The long-term trend of an annual consumption increase of1-2 percent is expected to continue. It is also positive that there is no newcapacity coming on stream in the next few years.ROTTNEROS PACKAGING’S NEW MACHINE UP AND RUNNING BY YEAR ENDOur efforts in Rottneros Packaging follow plan. The new machine is ready to bedelivered and will start up at the end of the fourth quarter. Demand for climate-smart packaging products and fiber trays continues to be high and is growingrapidly.In September, a tragic death of a truck driver occurred whilst picking up goodsfrom Vallvik Mill. Although the cause is yet not clear, the incident underscoresthe importance of always putting safety first in our workplaces. Our thoughts goto the deceased’s relatives, friends and colleagues.In conclusion, it is clear that we have established a new level of availabilityand production volumes in the mills. This creates continued growthopportunities, not least in our selected niches. Our focus is to constantlyoptimize the factors that we can influence ourselves regardless of externalfactors. With a strong spirit in the organization and solid finances, we arewell prepared for both challenges and opportunities. Once again, I would like toextend a warm thanks to our organization, customers and suppliers.Lennart Eberleh, President and CEO(For full report, please see attached file)This information is information that Rottneros AB is obliged to publish underthe EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Securities Market Act.

Sportamore AB,2019-10-22 08:00:00,"Continued growth and increased profitabilityThis year’s third quarter has been an enjoyable and important one forSportamore. We continue to deliver growth according to plan, with total sales*growing by 17.4 per cent and totalling SEK 252.4 (214.9) million, while our long-term work on automation, efficiency and scalability is taking the tangibleform of actual profitability. The EBIT figure for the third quarter was boostedto SEK 2.8 (-0.5) million, signalling a distinct reverse in the Group’s profittrend. This is done in a quarter where the market continues to be characterizedby high campaign intensity.Significantly increasing order value and gross marginThe average order value increased by no less than 13 per cent during the period.This trend is being driven by the introduction of a minimum order value for freedelivery in all markets, which resulted in an increasing number of products perorder but also an increasing average sales price. This change is having a majorimpact on the Group’s cost structure per order which means that profitability isseeing a radical improvement. In addition, an increased element ofautomated pricing and more surgical campaign work means that we have boosted thegross margin by 1.6 percentage points.Strengthened cost structure and efficiency improvements for improvedprofitability[image]Our enhanced focus on profitability is now starting to seriously improve theGroup’s income statement. Alongside work to increase the order value, we havealso introduced several initiatives in automation for scalability andefficiency. This is contributing to the operating expenses excluding product andmarketing expenses as a proportion of operating income during the periodreflected a positive development, falling from 28.8 per cent in the firstquarter (28.3 per cent in the second quarter) to 25.9 per cent in the thirdquarter. We look forward to the increased benefit of these initiatives whenturnover keep growing and continue along with unstinting work to rationalise andautomate all of Sportamore’s processes.Looking ahead, we expect a continued strong gross margin compared with lastyear, and at the same time expect continued rationalisation combined withincreasing order value to contribute to an improved cost structure in the fourthquarter as well. This means that we still believe that 2019 will generate animproved profit on a full-year basis compared with 2018, while at the same timethe growth in the customer base is increasing our future potential.New marketsDuring the period, we have started our active customer recruitment in the newly-launched French market and we are now working to ensure the right keyindicators and cost structure before investing in further growth. We havemade good progress in our investment in automation and scalable processes,laying a solid foundation for the opportunity to continue to scale up our totalgeographical market. Against this background, we are now investigating thepotential in additional geographical regions.Healthy finances and saleable stockThe Group’s financial position remains healthy, with cash in hand on the balancesheet date totalling SEK 67.2 (90.9) million, excluding an overdraft facility ofSEK 40.0 million. The value of stock at the end of the period totalled SEK 322.0(275.9) million, and the stock has good saleability with less than 17 percent more than six months old. The stock turnover rate is increasing inaccordance with the previously stated ambition, which is of course positive,while at the same time we still feel that the correlation between sales andstock has to be improved, which is why we will be focusing on making sure thatthis happens in the periods ahead. All in all, we are better positioned than ever to face the all-important fourthquarter.*Own sales plus the total value of products sold from commission-based revenues,where own sales refers to operating income less provision from commission-basedsales.This information is information that Sportamore AB (publ) is obligated todisclose pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Swedish SecuritiesMarket Act.

SAAB AB,2019-10-22 07:30:00,"Saab presents the results for January-September 2019.Statement by the President and CEO Håkan Buskhe:Strong orders, organic growth and continued margin improvementDuring the first nine months of 2019, Saab reported a strong order intake and anorganic growth of 11 per cent. The development is in line with Saab’s goals:continued sales growth and improved margins. The focus has continued to be onthe implementation of Saab’s major programs. Executing them according to plan isthe basis of Saab’s development, together with further investments in technologyand internationalisation.OrdersOrder bookings amounted to SEK 19,093 million (17,183) in the first nine months.Several orders contributed positively to the quarter, primarily the order fromFinland’s Ministry of Defence to provide and integrate combat system forFinland’s new corvettes as part of the Squadron 2020 programme. This is a majormilestone for Saab as it means a reference customer in advanced combat systems,integration and sensors. Further, it is of strategic importance for Saab whenother countries procure this type of advanced systems.Small orders continued to grow compared to the third quarter of 2018. Increasingthe number of small and medium-sized orders has been a goal for Saab. Marketdemand remains strong and going forward Saab sees good business opportunities.Sales and operating incomeSales in the first three quarters amounted to SEK 24,855 million (22,138),corresponding to an organic growth of 11 per cent. The increase is mainly drivenby business area Dynamics but also from strong development in other businessareas.Operating income amounted to SEK 1,739 million (1,142) with an operating marginof 7.0 per cent (5.2). Saab has continued to strongly focus on implementationand delivery of key milestone projects, while at the same time, it is importantto efficiently develop the smaller sized and recurring businesses.Efforts to improve efficiency and increase productivity are continuing and themeasures taken are reflected in the period’s stronger operating margin comparedto the third quarter of 2018. The work to adapt the product portfolio is alsomaking progress. Digitalization and automation of operations are continuing andduring the quarter several steps were taken to more efficiently manage marketsand sales, such as the appointment of Chief Marketing Officer, who will become amember of the Group Management.Operational cash flowOperational cash flow amounted to SEK -4,356 million (-5,197) and is in linewith the development previously communicated for 2019. The negative cash flowcan mainly be attributed to the high level of completion of Saab’s majorcontracts, mainly in Aeronautics. Saab maintains its view that operational cashflow will be at a better level for the full-year 2019 than 2018, as largemilestone payments are scheduled in the fourth quarter.CEO changeDuring the third quarter, Håkan Buskhe announced that he is stepping down asPresident and CEO of Saab. The Board appointed Micael Johansson as hissuccessor, he takes over on October 23.Outlook statement for 2019We estimate that sales growth in 2019 will be in line with Saab’s long-termfinancial goal: annual organic sales growth of 5 per cent.The operating margin in 2019, excluding material non-recurring items, isexpected to improve compared to 2018, bringing Saab a step closer to its long-term financial goal: an operating margin of 10 per cent per year over abusiness cycle.Financial highlightsMSEK                Jan-Sep      Jan-Sep  Change,      Q3 2019      Q3 2018Full Year                       2019         2018        %2018Order bookings       19,093       17,183       11        9,383        4,51927,975Order backlog        96,004      102,400       -6102,184Sales                24,855       22,138       12        7,914        6,41933,156Gross income          5,466        4,976       10        1,678        1,4397,764Gross margin,          22.0         22.5                  21.2         22.423.4%EBITDA ³⁾             2,742        1,528       79          849          2053,182EBITDA margin,         11.0          6.9                  10.7          3.29.6%Operating             1,739          844      106          518          -612,266income (EBIT)Operating               7.0          3.8                   6.5         -1.06.8margin, %Adjusted              1,739        1,142       52          518          2372,564operatingincomeAdjusted                7.0          5.2                   6.5          3.77.7operatingmargin, %Net income            1,121          358      213          295          -921,366of which              1,100          331      232          269          -941,313ParentCompany’sshareholders’interestEarnings per           8.21         2.84                  2.01        -0.8111.21share afterdilution, SEK¹⁾Return on              13.1          7.18.1equity, % ²⁾Operational          -4,356       -5,197                -1,654       -2,447-2,424cash flowFree cash flow       -4,991       -5,699                -1,865       -2,507-3,195Free cash flow       -37.25       -48.91                -13.95       -21.52-27.27per shareafterdilution, SEK¹⁾ Average      133,994,725  116,515,174           133,702,351  116,499,013117,144,915number ofshares afterdilution²⁾ Return onequity ismeasured overa rolling12-monthperiod.³⁾ EBITDA forthe firstnine months2019 iseffected bytheimplementationof IFRS16 withadditionaldepreciationsof MSEK293.

Totalsales grew by 13% with an improved underlying operating margin. Sales growth inthe quarter was driven by organic growth of 4%, acquired net growth of 4% andpositive currency movements of 5%. Organic growth was strong in Americas (6%)and Global Technologies (6%). Entrance Systems and EMEA reported good growth(3%), while sales in Asia Pacific declined (-1%).Operating income increased by 14% to SEK 3,894 M, driven by good operatingleverage. The operating margin was unchanged at 16.2%, but if adjusted foracquisition costs of SEK 55 M related to agta record, the margin increased by 20basis points. The underlying improvement was driven by lower raw material costs,prices increases and operational improvements.Operating cash flow was very strong and improved by 47% to SEK 4,401 M, drivenby the improved earnings and working capital reductions. Our cash conversion inthe quarter was 113%.Good execution in the quarterOverall, the underlying growth slowed somewhat in the quarter. As newconstruction indices continue to trend down in some of our more importantmarkets and geopolitical challenges remain, the market conditions have becomemore challenging and uncertain.Against that background I am pleased with our strong operational execution. Itis encouraging to see that the mitigating actions we initiated last year tocompensate for higher raw material costs, have resulted in strong improvementsin operating leverage generally and for Entrance Systems, Americas and EMEA inparticular.The negative organic sales growth in Asia Pacific during the quarter was mainlydriven by a weak South Korean market and negative growth in China. We arecontinuing the implementation of our new Chinese business plan where margins arenow stabilizing and where we are seeing the first small results from the actionsinitiated.Our restructuring programs also continued to advance well and generated savingsof around SEK 200 M in the quarter. Due to the high speed of implementation ofthe most recent program, this level will slow down from the next quarter and in2020 we expect the savings to be about SEK 300 M.Acquisitions will add growthWith the acquisitions already announced, and assuming the consolidation of agtarecord, we have reached our acquisition target of 5% for 2020. Nevertheless, wewill continue to work actively on our acquisition pipeline.Finally, I would like to thank you for your interest in ASSA ABLOY and take thisopportunity to inform you that we will host our next Capital Markets Day on 13May 2020 in London.Stockholm, 18 October 2019Nico DelvauxPresident and CEOFurther information can be obtained from:Nico Delvaux,President and CEO, tel. no: +46 8 506 485 82Erik Pieder,Executive Vice President and CFO, tel.no: +46 8 506 485 72ASSA ABLOY is holding a telephone and web conference at 09.30 on 18 October 2019which can be followed on the Internet at www.assaabloy.com.It is possible to submit questions by telephone on:+46 8–566 427 07, +44 333 300 9267 or +1 833 526 8383This information is information that ASSA ABLOY AB is obliged to make publicpursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

The main reasons for the 21% increase in income arethe implemented price increases, the continuing decline in pulp prices andeffective cost controls. Income was impacted negatively by higher logisticscosts and inventory revaluation effects related to lower pulp prices.A more sustainable Duni driving growthNet sales increased by 11.7% at fixed exchange rates. This increase mainly stemsfrom our acquisitions, which continue to perform well. Organic pro formagrowth[1)] for the quarter amounted to 3.1%. The trend from previous quarterscontinued, with growth being driven primarily by sustainable packaging solutionsbut also premium napkins. The table cover market continues to decline while thesustainable packaging market is experiencing strong growth.Duni’s goal is to build BioPak into a global brand, and the brand was launchedin Singapore during the quarter along with the first parts of the product rangein Europe. On October 1, we also completed a complementary acquisition of theAustralian company Horizons, which further strengthens our existing position asa market leader in sustainable packaging in Australia.Performance of our business areasThe Meal Service and New Markets business areas performed well in terms of bothsales and operating income. Table Top experienced slightly positive sales growthand margin improvements while Consumer reported a decrease in both sales andoperating income. In line with the retail market, the Consumer business areaexperienced a continued negative income performance, and we have now initiated aprogram to further strengthen synergies within the business area.Stable pulp pricesWe observed that pulp prices were down further in the third quarter but thisdecline is now expected to come to a stop.

Total ordersreceived amounted to SEK 964.6m (817.9), equivalent to a currency-neutral growthof 10.0 percent. Net sales totalled SEK 1,088.6m (835.2), equivalent to acurrency-neutral growth of 22.4 percent. The trend in EMEA remained positive,with healthy growth in both orders received and sales. In the Americas, ordersreceived deteriorated slightly compared with the corresponding period in 2018.Demand in the APAC region remained weak.Development in the quarter is in line with our expectations. Europe reportedanother strong quarter. In the Americas, our focus on profitability improvementshas now yielded results in the form of stronger operating profit. It is alsoworth noting that the Nederman Extraction & Filtration Technology divisionreported a positive performance in the US during the quarter. Meanwhile, we arecontinuing to see major investment decisions in the US being deferred into thefuture. Development in Asia was weak, with investments in China remaining at lowlevels.OutlookMany of our markets, not least the US and China, continue to be characterised byuncertainty. Trade conflicts and financial uncertainty mean that decisions onmajor investments are being delayed and that large projects are being postponed.We have also noted increasing signs of a general slowdown in the world economy.Despite these challenges, our basic view is one of cautious optimism.Environmental issues will remain important for our customers and we arecontinuing to strengthen our positions in several key areas where we see thatfuture growth will occur. In Europe and North America, we will build onNederman’s strengths as a leading environmental technology company. In regard tothe developments in Asia, which are not aligned with our ambitions, we arecontinuing our intensive efforts to reverse the trend.Nederman Future DaysClean air is becoming a rare luxury. According to the Health Effects Institute(HEI) in the US, 95 percent of the world’s population is exposed every day topoor quality air. This is the basis for Nederman’s ambition to become the “CleanAir Company” and to show that the solutions to current problems of air pollutionlargely can be found in industry.This is also why we held the Nederman Future Days event during the quarter.

The adjustedEBITDA excluding IFRS 16 impacts grew by 1 percent on a like-for-like basis inthe third quarter compared to the decline of 3 percent in the first half of2019. Operational free cash flow is positive and amounts to SEK 11.6 billionyear-to-date, compared to SEK 9.4 billion in the corresponding period 2018. Theimprovement is mainly driven by acquisitions and working capital, some of whichshould be seen as phasing between quarters. We reiterate our outlook for 2019 atSEK 12-12.5 billion. The service revenue trend has improved with a decline of1.3 percent in the third quarter versus a 2 percent decline during the firsthalf of the year. Overall service revenues have been supported by commercialactivities in the consumer side, which are expected to have additional positiveimpacts in the coming quarters but burdened by legacy and a slightly weakerenterprise segment versus the second quarter.I have now spent one month as acting CEO of this great company. After five yearsas CFO, I know the strategy well and I am committed to deliver on it. It is nowtime to further increase our focus on execution. In Sweden we have the ambitionto bring high speed, high quality broadband services to all households, both onour award-winning mobile network and on our own and others’ fiber networks. Wehave taken steps forward in this area and we will enhance our service revenuesfurther. We also see that we gradually increase our market share in theenterprise segment, especially through ICT services. In Norway we will have asimilar position enabled by Get and the upgrade to 5G we announced last week. InFinland we increase our capabilities, most recently through the roll-out of 5Gin the largest cities and the launch of 5G subscriptions with up to 1,000 Mbit/sspeeds. The strong positions across our markets create an even betteropportunity to enhance customer experience, through convergence, where we havenot yet lived up to our full potential. We are also excited and eager to utilizethe strengths of Bonnier Broadcasting once the EU Commission has made its finaldecision, expected on November 19, at the latest. In the enterprise segment wehave proven our skills in ICT, especially in IoT where we are currently growingrevenues by more than 20 percent. This provides further proof points of ourstrategy to be the digital partner of choice.Apart from strengthened customer experience and loyalty, convergence will alsoimprove return on investments, both now and in the future, and as such createshareholder value.The focus on reducing our cost base continues, where our new operating modelcreates a good platform to become a more efficient company. By restructuring ourdelivery model and technology platform we expect improvement in speed to marketwhilst also generating material IT and network spend efficiencies. By the end ofthe year we will have reached a run rate of around SEK 200 million in annualcosts savings from the new operating model. As of October 1, 2019, we haveonboarded Finland, moving some 250 employees to our unit Common Products andServices. Norway, Estonia and Denmark will follow on January 1, 2020. Finally,we will continue to focus on our sustainability agenda including our daringgoals.We repeat our second quarter statement, that the operational free cash flowcomposition in 2019 differs from our initial plans. We have delivered fasterthan planned on changes in working capital and it has boosted current cash flowmeanwhile lowering the upside going forward. We also see that the opportunity toreduce CAPEX in 2020 is limited, as we foresee more need from customer drivendemand, our ambition in fiber broadband, as well as remaining the leader inmobile through 5G. We have a stable base, on top of which Bonnier Broadcastingwill contribute once the transaction is approved. However, considering all thefactors there is currently a higher uncertainty on the operational free cashflow level for 2020.Despite turning the trend, we have a slower than expected recovery of theservice revenues, impacting our financial leverage expectations negatively.Adding a potentially weaker economic outlook, we have decided not to execute onthe remaining SEK 5 billion of the three-year share buy-back program. Since thestart we have committed to use SEK 10 billion, or around 6 percent additionalreturn to our shareholders. Both management and the Board of Directors continueto see the ordinary dividend as a strong fundament for creating shareholdervalue.As mentioned above our outlook for the full year operational free cash flow ofbetween SEK 12-12.5 billion is reiterated. We will provide an outlook for 2020in connection to the fourth quarter results.I would like to send a sincere thank you to our employees for the strong effortsso far in 2019.

Through Samtrans and ÖrslevHolding, we have established a strong position in the segment for special needstransportation, where we see continued favourable long-term growth opportunitiesand a potential for further efficiency gains within the Group.EXTENSIVE CONTRACT MIGRATIONWe have now entered a period with several major traffic start-ups andterminations, referred to as contract migration, which often results in atemporary drop in profitability. During the second quarter, we noted smallnegative effects in the Swedish operations, but during the next two quarters themigration will have a more tangible negative effect, also keeping in mind thechallenging comparative figures. But as I have said many times before,profitability in new contracts is always at its lowest early in the contractperiod, and gradually improves as time passes. With the stringent demands weimpose on which contracts we want to win, combined with the growth in volume,the current migration will make a positive contribution to reaching ourfinancial targets.A GROWING BUSINESSAt the same time, we are looking forward to securing new contracts in connectionwith the substantial tender volumes we are facing in the coming quarters,particularly in Sweden and Denmark. As few of our own contracts are expiring, wesee significant potential to add market shares and accelerate Nobina’s growth.Our position as market leader in the Nordic region for public transport entailsgreater responsibility for the transport solutions, and thereby more businessopportunities. One such area is digital so-called MaaS solutions (Mobility as aService) for smoother door-to-door travel, where we have several excitingprojects underway. Nobina is helping to drive this development in the Nordiccountries which makes me a little extra proud.ESG-ACTIVITIES IN FOCUSI am also proud that Nobina has been named by the Unionen trade union asSweden’s most LGBT-friendly workplace, proof that we live by our values ofhaving respect for each other, caring and being good leaders and have also forthe seventh consecutive year been both sponsor and partner to Stockholm Pride.We have also continued, through our own efforts and in collaboration with jobcentres, to help longterm unemployed, being trained as bus drivers. Socialcommitment is one important aspect of our ESG work, which also includestechnology and solutions to improve air quality and increase mobility. In thesecond quarter, we began operating 92 electric buses, and of 373 buses that arecurrently on order 38 are electric buses and all of the others are adapted tooperate on fossil-free fuel. Our efforts to deliver efficient sustainablesolutions for society is being recognised by more and more investors, whounderstand the value of this in order to create profitable growth. Good supportfor this view can be found from the independent climate research instituteCicero, which in conjunction with the issue of our green bond earlier this year,gave us the highest “dark green” ranking for our green framework andsustainability agenda. This is the first time this has been given to a publictransport company.IMPORTANT DECISIONFinally, I would like to highlight the significance of fair competition for fairpricing in the market. The European Commission has, after our filed complaint,ordered a former municipal bus company in Finland to repay EUR 54.2 million inincompatible public support during an extended period. This decision strengthensus in our efforts moving forward to develop the public transport of the futurein both Finland and the rest of the Nordic region.Magnus Rosén,President and CEOThe information comprises such as Nobina AB (publ) is obliged to publiclydisclose pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Securities MarketAct.

Online sales increased 20per cent and operating profit* improved to 79 MSEK, 32 MSEK year-on-year. Thisis a positive sales trend, with healthy sales of seasonal products alsoimpacting the inventory value in the right direction. The inventory value of1,955 MSEK is lower than in the preceding quarter, but slightly higher year-on-year. The inventory level reflects the preparations for upcoming campaigns andlargely comprises consumables that are part of our ordinary range for whichthere is continued high demand. We can also see a strong cash flow for the firstquarter.A unique and complete offering – new partnership with KolonialIn a broader perspective, we continue to see the same rapid pace of change inthe retail sector as previously. This change is being driven by digitalisation,new customer behaviour and global competition. For this reason, we arecontinuing to leave no stone unturned to build a Clas Ohlson with long-termprofitability, and we are implementing our strategic plan including both growthand efficiency initiatives at a fast pace.Proximity to the customer is set to become increasingly important and we are nowtaking further steps to establish a unique position in our Nordic home marketsin terms of availability and convenience for our customers. Through a newpartnership with Kolonial.no, Norway’s largest online food retailer, we have thepossibility to interact with our Norwegian customers in new channels and offernew smart delivery alternatives for our products right to their door. We havepositive experience of our partnership with Mathem in Sweden, with one in tencustomer deliveries now including a Clas Ohlson product, and we are lookingforward to from today offer Clas Ohlson products through Kolonial’s popularonline shopping platform.A profitable store networkAvailability and convenience are also key words for our stores. The large growthin the industry is now taking place online, but we can see that stores willcontinue to play an important role going forward. The lion’s share of our salestakes place in our stores and this means that profitable stores are necessaryfor our goal of sustainable profitable growth. Apart from serving as a key saleschannel, the stores provide a customer experience, a service offering and theopportunity to collect products ordered online using Click & Collect – our mostpopular and most cost-effective delivery option.This means that we need to ensure that our stores are in locations where ourcustomers want us to be, with the right format and with judicious balancebetween cost and revenue per square meter. Due to changing consumption pattern,we will change both the number of stores and their orientation at a faster pace.Some get bigger, others get smaller, some disappear and others will be added. Aspart of this work, we have decided to close four stores in Finland and one inSweden. The continuous optimisation of our store network and securing flexiblelease terms will remain priorities in future.Continued focus on efficiency enhancementsAs previously communicated, we are investing 1-2 per cent of the operatingmargin in our strategic initiatives over a two-year period. In addition togrowth-driving initiatives, efficiency-enhancing measures equivalent toapproximately 200-250 MSEK have been identified to date. We are following ourplan and efficiency enhancements will remain in focus. However, the impact ofthese initiatives on the operations and our financial results will vary in linewith them being fully realised.The road ahead is not straight, but we are seeing the positive effects of thework and activities that we have conducted to date, which strengthens our beliefthat we are on the right track. Accordingly, we will do more of what we havesaid we will do and maintain a high pace in the implementation of our plan tocreate even greater value for our customers and shareholders in the form ofsustainable profitable growth.Lotta LyråPresident and CEO of Clas Ohlson AB*Operating profit for the quarter was positively impacted by approximately 27MSEK, due to the new accounting standard for leases, IFRS 16.Press and analyst conferenceThe report will be presented today at 9:00 a.m. in Clas Ohlson’s store atSveavägen 52 in Stockholm.

SECTRA AB,2019-09-03 08:15:00,"Press release – Linköping, September 3, 2019 – International medical imaging ITand cybersecurity company Sectra (https://investor.sectra.com/) (STO: SECT B)reported growth in all operating areas during the first quarter. The fastestgrowth was reported by the operations in the US, where more customers choseSectra’s scalable enterprise imaging solution to create a unified strategy formedical diagnostic imaging and improved patient care.First quarter in figures  · Order bookings amounted to SEK 238.7 million (286.5). Of the order bookingsduring the quarter, 28% were recognized as revenue during the quarter and 26% to36% pertain to revenue within 12 months after the end of the quarter.  · Net sales rose 13.3% to SEK 332.8 million (293.7). Adjusted for currencyfluctuations, sales increased 10.6%.  · Operating profit totaled SEK 29.4 million (35.6), corresponding to anoperating margin of 8.8% (12.1). Adjusted for currency fluctuations, operatingprofit decreased 23.3%.  · Profit before tax amounted to SEK 30.6 million (33.7).  · Cash flow after changes in working capital amounted to a negative SEK 28.0million (15.9).Torbjörn Kronander, President and CEO of Sectra AB, comments“After a year of record-high order bookings, we are reporting a more cautiousbeginning to 2019/2020. All operating areas are growing, we are making majorinvestments for the future and we are following our plans. The orders from lastyear are now moving into the product delivery and customer deployment stage,which affected profit and cash flow for the period. This is particularly true aswe needed to increase our costs (primarily on the personnel side) to managethese major deployments, yet the orders will not generate revenue until a laterstage. Comprehensive and long-term customer contracts provide long-termstability, but they also lead to negative cash flows and major costs during theinstallation phase. The increased costs for deployment also meant that we, forthe first time in a long time, did not achieve one of our financial goals duringthe quarter. Five-year growth in EBIT per share ended the quarter at 44% (thegoal is 50%). When the installation phase is over, the costs will be replaced byrevenue and positive cash flows for a long time to come.“Within the Imaging IT Solutions operating area, the US is currently one of ourfastest-growing markets. During the quarter, we received orders from newcustomers, including the Vanderbilt Medical Center, one of the most famoushospitals in the US. We also completed the installation at Stanford Health Care,a prestigious order that we received one year ago. Sectra’s high levels ofcustomer satisfaction and long-term work are strengthening our position, and theUS has now outgrown Sweden as the Group’s largest market in terms of sales.“As for our security operations, we acquired the assets of the Swedish ITsecurity company Columbitech AB and shares in its US subsidiary during thequarter. The acquisition is in line with our strategy to expand primarilythrough organic growth, supplemented by acquisitions that strengthen thisorganic growth. The acquisition will establish Secure Communications in the US,while also strengthening our expertise and complementing the operating area’scybersecurity products.”For further CEO comments and information, see the attached interim report.Presentation of the interim reportA presentation will be held by Torbjörn Kronander, President and CEO of SectraAB, and Mats Franzén, CFO of Sectra AB.

SAS AB,2019-08-27 08:00:00,"MAY 2019–JULY 2019  · Revenue: MSEK 13,552 (13,146)  · Income before tax (EBT): MSEK 1,490 (2,034)  · Income before tax and items affecting comparability: MSEK 1,495 (2,008)  · Net income for the period: MSEK 1,162 (1,570)  · Earnings per common share SEK 3.04 (4.04)  · Income before tax negatively affected by strike MSEK -185SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE QUARTER  · SAS reports record number of passengers in June and July  · SAS and Airbus enter into joint research project on hybrid and electricaircraft in commercial traffic  · Pilot strike for two days at the beginning of the quarter resulting in 1,200cancelled flights and 100,000 affected passengersSIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER THE QUARTER ENDED  · SAS announces new organizational structure effective from 1 OctoberNOVEMBER 2018–JULY 2019  · Revenue: MSEK 33,273 (32,040)  · Income before tax (EBT): MSEK -302 (1,261)  · Income before tax and items affecting comparability:MSEK -440 (1,314)  · Net income for the period: MSEK -240 (972)  · Earnings per common share: SEK -0.65 (2.16)  · Income before tax negatively affected by strike MSEK -615COMMENTS BY THE CEOThe third quarter was characterized by strong operational performance togetherwith successful seasonal adaptation, resulting in record passenger numbers andincreased revenue in the peak season. Although the revenue increase isencouraging, the prevailing macroeconomic headwinds require improved efficiencyto secure competitiveness and long-term profitability.Total revenue ended at MSEK 13,552, representing an increase of over 3% comparedwith the same quarter last year. The decline in capacity caused by the pilotstrike was compensated by increased passenger revenue. Moreover, SAS posted acontinued positive trend in the sale of EuroBonus points and ancillary revenue.Earnings before tax and items affecting comparability, came in at MSEK 1,495, adisappointing decrease of MSEK 513 year-on-year. The decline was mainlyattributable to increased fuel costs, the Swedish krona’s continued weaknessagainst the US dollar, as well as the pilot strike at the beginning of thequarter. However, it is encouraging to note that our successful adaptation toseasonal demand and improved operational quality led to a strong customer uptakeand an increased yield, thereby mitigating parts of the additional costsincurred during the quarter.Notably, the headwind stemming from a weak SEK and signs of a slowdown in theEuropean economy, accentuate the need for SAS to adapt operations to currentmarket conditions and accelerate the transformation agenda to secure long-termprofitability beyond 2020.IMPROVED OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND SEASONAL ADAPTATIONSAS has its peak season during the third quarter, with strong demand from bothleisure and business passengers. In recent years, we have adapted our offeringto meet customer demand by shifting summer capacity toward leisure-orientedroutes. This year we launched 25 new routes in our summer program, whereof fivebrand new destinations: Florence, Marseille, Szczecin, Cornwall and Oulu. Thecapacity shift has proven to be successful and we were able to report newrecords for passenger numbers in both June and July.Demand for domestic flights in Norway and Denmark remains strong and we continueto post healthy growth compared to last year. Even in the declining market fordomestic flights in Sweden, the number of passengers that chose to travel withSAS remained at the same levels as last year. We view this as proof of anattractive customer offering.Looking ahead, forecasts for the remainder of the year indicate a marketcapacity growth of approximately 1% for the full year 2019 and early indicationspoint to moderate growth in 2020 as well. This is a trend shift from recentyears, where annual capacity growth has been 3-4% per annum. In the near term,this moderate growth outlook is encouraging and should help improve thesupply/demand balance, which should be beneficial for the Scandinavian market.However, in the longer term, the significant order book of new aircraft to bedelivered until 2024 carries a risk of structural overcapacity in the Europeanairspace.In terms of operational quality, we recorded a strong improvement compared tothe same period last year when we faced a number of operational challenges.Since then, we have taken several actions to improve stability and avoid trafficdisruption. We have recruited and trained more seasonal staff in ground handlingand technical maintenance. Moreover, we have added two spare aircraft,implemented a new disruption module, and selectively adjusted the network tooptimize the reallocation of buffers and stand-by capacity. As a result, we havethroughout the summer delivered operational regularity well above 99%. Whatmakes me particularly proud is that we were able to deliver the same operationalrobustness across all production platforms, thereby resulting in generallyimproved customer satisfaction.ROADMAP TOWARDS FURTHER EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTSOur current efficiency improvement program targets SEK 3 billion in efficiencyimprovements by 2020 to strengthen competitiveness and mitigate some of theannual cost inflation. In the third quarter, our efficiency program deliveredover MSEK 230 and in the year to date we have realized MSEK 626 in savings.Since 2017 the program has realized SEK 2.1 billion out of the targeted SEK 3billion.Although we stay firm on our target of delivering MSEK 900 in savings for thefiscal year 2019, our unit cost, after adjustment for strike effects, is notdecreasing to the extent we wish. This means that we need to look at additionalinitiatives beyond 2020.The renewal of our fleet is one important component, since it moves SAS to asingle-type fleet which decreases complexity in the organization and therebycosts. Another component is to further optimize our operating model based onthree production platforms to further boost flexibility and efficiency.Another area of importance is our continued digitalization efforts to furthersupport revenue growth, decrease costs and at the same time add value for ourcustomers. These include utilizing digital tools to improve planning, both forassets and for crew. This will ensure continued stable production as well asoptimize organizational efficiency. Other efforts include the introduction ofpredictive maintenance for our aircraft and other automation to increaseefficiency. Personalized customer offerings, on-board high-speed WiFi andimproved self-service possibilities, are other areas which are aimed directly atour customers to safeguard our strong value proposition and attractiveness.To accelerate our efficiency efforts and drive accountability, a new GroupManagement organizational structure will be implemented as of 1 October 2019.Our current Operations unit will be divided into Airline Operations, withresponsibility for airline operations across all production platforms, andAirline Services, with responsibility for Ground Handling, Technical Maintenanceand Cargo. Furthermore, all sales, marketing and commercial units will beconsolidated under one Commercial entity. With the new Group Management team inplace, we are committed to deliver on our accelerated transformation agenda aswell as the additional initiatives needed to increase efficiency across theorganization.CONTINUED PROGRESS IN DECREASING CLIMATE IMPACTAt SAS, we are currently working on several activities to reduce our negativeclimate footprint. The delivery of new and more fuel-efficient aircraft is acornerstone in our endeavor to reduce carbon emissions. With new aircraft fromAirbus, our emissions will be reduced with up to 18% on short-haul and up to 30%on long-haul flights. We have also replaced the interiors in our existingaircraft and decided to remove tax-free sales onboard to reduce weight and fuelconsumption. Moreover, we continuously strive to reduce plastic consumables andfood waste onboard.SAS is also engaged in a joint research project together with Airbus related tothe electrification of aircraft for large-scale commercial usage in the future.In order to bridge the gap to zero emission aircraft, we believe that animportant step is to increase the usage of renewable fuels to reduce emissionsmore rapidly. SAS is pushing for large-scale production of advanced renewablefuel in Scandinavia. The volumes being produced today are simply not enough andthe price is 3-4 times higher than for conventional jet fuel. During thequarter, we added the possibility for our customers to purchase biofuel (atcost), in addition to the amount of biofuel SAS is already using. We believethat this provides an opportunity for customers to contribute and createstransparency around the additional costs for biofuel.In the meantime, we are also addressing the CO2 emissions that we cannoteliminate with today’s technology. During the quarter we had compensated forover 3.5 million journeys with SAS, representing 38% of the total passenger-related CO2 emissions in the third quarter.OUTLOOKEven though the capacity outlook and recent decline in jet fuel price arepositives, several challenges remain unchanged since our Q2 report.

Particulary has segment Rest of Nordics showed improvedmargins. Sales for the quarter amounted to SEK 1,406 (1,174) million. Growth forthe quarter was 19.8 percent, of which 2.7 percent was organic growth. AdjustedEBITA for the second quarter was SEK 123 (107) million, which corresponds to anadjusted EBITA margin of 8.7 (9.2) percent.Order backlog remained stable and at the end of the quarter, it amounted to SEK4,508 (3,875) million, which corresponds to an increase of 16.3 percent.New companies and operationsWe’ve continued to actively pursue our acquisition agenda and during thequarter, we acquired several new, interesting companies and operations, whichhas broadened our geographic coverage and offering. Our acquisition of El &Säkerhet in Katrineholm strengthens our offering of electrical installationservices in Södermanland and Mälardalen, while our acquisition of Bogesunds El &Tele in Ulricehamn increases our presence in Västra Götaland.We also acquired DynaMate’s division for technical installations during theperiod. DynaMate AB is a wholly-­owned subsidiary of Scania CV AB in Södertälje.In Norway, we became established in Kristiansand, which is an exciting newmarket for us. We achieved this via our acquisition of Moi Rør, which primarilyfocuses on major heating & plumbing installation projects for industrialcustomers.Subsequent to the end of the reporting period, we acquired two Finnishcompanies, Pohjanmaan Taloteknikka and VIP-Sähkö, as well as OVAB, Rörtema andMilen Ventilation in Sweden. In total, these companies have estimated annualsales of around SEK 350 million. So far this year, it means that we’ve acquiredannual sales of slightly more than SEK 1,000 million, which far exceeds our goalof SEK 600-800 million per year. It leads us to conclude that the acquisitionclimate remains favourable and interest in becoming part of the Instalco Groupis high.Also worth mentioning is that, during the quarter, we set up two of our own newcompanies, Insta EL in Malmö and Instamate in Södertälje, as a supplement to ouracquisition strategy. Instamate is the company that will run operations of theinstallation division of DynaMate that we acquired.Synergies and cross-sellingCreating synergies and cross-selling between our companies are fundamentalcornerstones of Instalco’s business model. One very clear example of this is ourproject in Västerås, where five Instalco companies with different areas ofspecialisation are collaborating in a project for Axfood. Together, we willprovide heating & plumbing, electrical and ventilation installations along withcontrol & regulation technology associated with construction of a new Hemköpgrocery store.Our companies in Finland are also making progress and engaging in morecollaboration across areas of operations. During the quarter, LVI Paavola andSähkö-Buumi in Finland won a contract to collaborate on the heating, plumbingand electrical installations at a large office building in Helsinki that isbeing renovated.Wide portfolio generates order backlogWe expect to see a continued trend of high demand for installation services inall of our business areas. The rate of construction for residential property hasslowed down or fallen in parts of the Nordic region but other markets remainstrong. Instalco has a wide portfolio, however, particularly as regardshospitals, schools, office and commercial facilities and because of that, ourorder backlog has grown even more.Intalco’s Board of Directors was re-elected at the AGM in May.

Hoist Finance AB,2019-07-30 07:30:00,"Continued stable resultApril – June 2019  · Total operating income increased 23 per cent to SEK 797m (648).  · Profit before tax increased 63 per cent to SEK 230m (141).  · Earnings per share amounted to SEK 1.83 (1.12).  · Return on equity was 16 per cent (12).  · Carrying value of acquired loan portfolios totalled SEK 22,093m (20,605).  · The total capital ratio was 14.12 per cent (14.14) and the CET1 capitalratio was 9.91 per cent (9.66).Figures in brackets refer to second quarter 2018 for profit/loss comparisons andto the closing balance at 31 December 2018 for balance sheet items.Events during the quarter  · Second largest debt collector in the Polish market. Hoist Finance finalisedthe acquisition of assets totalling PLN 400m from the Polish debt restructuringcompany GetBack.  · Finalisation of acquisition of Italian debt collection company Maran Group,which complements the current setup perfectly in the ambition to be a marketleader.  · Robert Kraal and Lars Wollung were elected as new members of the Board ofDirectors at the AGM.Subsequent events  · Hoist Finance has received investor commitment for a securitisation from theglobal asset manager CarVal.Continued stable resultThe second quarter of 2019 is the all-time high (excluding items affectingcomparability) for Hoist Finance, following the last high in the previousquarter. We are pleased to see that our operating model with standardised andharmonised work processes across all markets is delivering as expected. HoistFinance is becoming more effective, efficient and digital. Our collectionperformance is strong (104 per cent) and our cost to income ratio is improving(71 per cent).Our market remains very attractive with a strong pipeline and reduced pricepressure. The availability of low-cost funding remains a challenge for many ofthe competitors in the industry, and consequently, we see a trend towardscapital light models with asset management and servicing becoming more importantfor a number of companies. At the same time, the change in regulation isincreasing the supply of non-performing loans (NPL) across all asset classes.The M&A activity has been quite high in the first six months of the year, andthe industry consolidation is continuing. Hence, the market conditions arefavourable at this point in time and will most likely continue to develop in apositive direction going forward.Hoist Finance has been regulated as a bank since 1996, and the credit marketlicense has served us well over time. We have been able to adjust well toregulatory changes, and our business model has proven itself to be resilient. Webelieve that increased regulation is beneficial for our customers, counterpartsand the most professional companies in the industry. However, being regulated asa bank, some of the new regulatory changes have had unintended negativeconsequences for Hoist Finance. We are now working to address those throughimplementing mitigating actions, and this is progressing according to plan.One of our key mitigating actions is to implement a securitisation structurewhereby the underlying NPL risks are transferred from Hoist Finance. As a firststep, we are very pleased that we have received investor commitment for asecuritisation. I am very glad to see the good investor appetite and this is animportant step in the right direction towards maintaining a sustainable businessmodel in a post NPL Backstop world.A key cornerstone of our strategy is “becoming more digital”. Building on aharmonised operating model, we can now develop once, and then deploystandardised solutions across markets. This saves costs and increases speed ofexecution. We are pleased to have launched our self-service portal in two newmarkets in the quarter, and our self-service portal is now in production in allmarkets but one. This provide our customers with more possibilities for self-service and thus higher flexibility, this is also operationally more efficient.Strengthened capital enables continued growthDuring the first half of 2019, our investment volumes remained high and we havemade acquisitions of around SEK 2.3bn, all while strengthening our capital (CET1ratio 9,9 per cent). In the second quarter, we closed the transaction ofGetBack, which makes us the second largest player in the Polish market. Wecontinue to grow and our portfolio acquisition guidance in 2019 is SEK 5bnwithout mitigating actions.Sustainable business model - Helping people keep their commitmentsOur vison is “Helping people keep their commitments”. Our approach to collectionis amicable and holistic and being a regulated institution, we have set thehighest possible levels of ethics and compliance for ourselves. We are finding apath forward for individuals in a crisis, thus supporting families, communitiesand the society, in an effort to help people in a sustainable way.

Episurf Medical AB,2019-07-19 08:30:00,INTERIM REPORT 1 APRIL– 30 JUNE 2019
Gunnebo AB,2019-07-19 08:01:00,"Strong sales development and improved result in the second quarter. Cost-efficiency programme launched to accelerate margins improvement.President and CEO Henrik Lange Comments on Q2 2019:Order intake continued to have a positive development of 5% (2% in constantcurrencies), where both Entrance Control and Safe Storage showed double-digitgrowth of 14%. For Cash Management order intake in the US and Asia-Pacific wasslow. This is expected to improve in the second half of the year. For IntegratedSecurity, which had a contraction of order intake in the quarter, order levelsfluctuate between the quarters since this is a project-driven business.Sales for the Group had a strong development and were up 10% (7% in constantcurrencies) where growth came from Entrance Control and Safe Storage. EntranceControl had a very strong quarter with big project deliveries in all regions anda reported sales growth of 23% (22% in constant currencies). The continuedstrong growth within Entrance Control is confirmation that the Business Unit isnot only capturing the general 5% annual growth pace in the market, but alsogaining market share. In Safe Storage, sales grew 17% year-on-year (13% inconstant currencies) while Cash Management sales had a sales decline of -3% (-6%in constant currencies) while sales in Integrated Security were unchanged.ResultsThe Group’s overall EBITA of MSEK 73 was up 10% over last year and the EBITAmargin for the quarter was 5.3%, which is in line with last year. EntranceControl continues to deliver a strong margin, reporting an EBITA margin of12.9%. In Safe Storage it is encouraging to experience strong order intake andsales development, while the EBITA-margin of 7.8% is still not satisfactory. InCash Management order intake and sales contracted in the quarter. In their mainmarket, Europe, order intake and sales grew whereas they contracted both in theUS and Asia-Pacific, negatively affecting the EBITA margin. In IntegratedSecurity we had an improvement in EBITA compared to the same period last year.This is still not satisfactory, but we can see completed productivity measurescoming through.The announced cost-efficiency programme, which will have full effect from half-year 2020, will address our cost structure and generate improved profitability.Acquisition within Entrance Control and Rights IssueI am pleased to see that the Gunnebo Group continues to develop and adapt intothe new routines of the new Business Unit structure as set out about one yearago. As the order intake and sales in the quarter continued on a positive path,we also strengthened our Business Unit Entrance Control for the future with thesigning of the acquisition of the Czech company, Cominfo a.s. The acquisition,which was closed 1 July, is an important milestone in Gunnebo’s transformationjourney, adding both growth and profitability to an already well performingBusiness Unit and for the Group total as well. Cominfo is a good strategic fitfor Entrance Control since it will extend both its geographical footprint andproduct offering. Moreover, Cominfo will further strengthen Gunnebo’s positionas a world-leading supplier of entrance control solutions for pedestrians.In connection with the signing of the acquisition we also announced ourintention to perform a Rights Issue of some MSEK 360 to be carried out in thethird quarter of 2019. This will be used to reduce part of our debt, which istemporarily increased when purchasing Cominfo. As our balance sheet is improvedit also allows Gunnebo to better capture future opportunities in the market. Ourmain owners, Stena Adactum and Vätterleden Invest, are underwriting the RightsIssue, which shows trust and confidence in our strategy and execution.Cost-efficiency programme will accelerate margins improvementOne year into the transformation journey of focusing our business by fourBusiness Units, it is obvious that this focus is putting the Group on the righttrack towards profitable growth. We have been successful in making this majorshift of focus in our business in Europe, while generating good growth in orderintake and net sales alike throughout the past twelve months. With the announcedcost-efficiency programme, we will now enter into the final stage of dismantlingthe matrix organisation, where we will reduce unnecessary overhead costsfollowing the leaner and simplified way of operating our business. The programmewill generate cost savings of MSEK 100 where the initial effects will be seenfrom the beginning of 2020, with full effect after the first six months of 2020.The programme will bring non-recurring charges of MSEK 60, of which the majoritywill be recognised in the second half of 2019. The programme will comprise a mixof overhead cost reductions in Europe, mainly within the Safe Storage andIntegrated Security Business Units, as well as management changes in the GroupExecutive Team and the dismantling of regional structures in Asia-Pacific andthe Americas as of year-end. Charges connected to the programme will mainly bepeople-related and be reported as IAC costs.Stefan Syrén appointed new President and CEO and changes to the Group ExecutiveTeamWe have earlier today announced that I have decided to step down as Presidentand CEO by latest in November 2019. Stefan Syrén will at that point, in additionto his current duties as SVP for Business Units Safe storage and IntegratedSecurity, take over as President and CEO. With the new business focus andstructure in place, Gunnebo’s transformation journey will now enter a new phaseof executing on new sales opportunities in combination of delivering efficiencyimprovements. Therefore this is the right time for me to hand over theleadership to Stefan, who I am fully confident will, together with the GroupExecutive Team, take Gunnebo to the next level.When now entering into the next phase of our journey, we have also decided todiscontinue the regional structures in Asia-Pacific and Americas as of year-end2019. With this, Sacha de La Noë, SVP Region Asia-Pacific, Middle East andAfrica and Dan Schroeder, SVP Region Americas, will leave the Group ExecutiveTeam by year-end 2019. I would already now like to thank Sacha and Dan for anexcellent contribution to the Gunnebo Group.Gunnebo is now well positioned for growth and earnings improvementsIn the second quarter we can clearly see the positive impact from ourtransformation journey coming through, where good growth in both order intakeand sales in Entrance Control and Safe Storage are the strongest evidence.Adding a good acquisition, a fully underwritten Rights Issue and the initiatedcost-efficiency programme, I am confident that Gunnebo, with its new managementand strategy, is well positioned for both growth- and earnings improvementsahead.Gothenburg 19 July, 2019Henrik LangePresident & CEOSecond Quarter 2019  · Order intake amounted to MSEK 1,363 (1,293), equaling a year-on-year growthof 5% (2% in constant currencies)  · Net sales amounted to MSEK 1,368 (1,248), equaling a year-on-year growth of10% (7% in constant currencies)  · EBITA amounted to MSEK 73 (66) and the EBITA margin to 5.3% (5.3)  · IAC costs net amounted to MSEK -3 (-9)  · Operating profit (EBIT) amounted to MSEK 68 (52)  · Net profit for the period amounted to MSEK 24 (20)  · Earnings per share amounted to SEK 0.32 (0.25)  · Free cash flow amounted to MSEK -6 (-63)  · Cost-efficiency programme launched to accelerate margins improvement  · Signing of the acquisition of Cominfo and announcement of the intention tocarry out a fully underwritten Rights Issue during the third quarter of 2019  · Stefan Syrén appointed new President and CEO and changes in the GroupExecutive Team announced on July 19, 2019January-June 2019  · Order intake amounted to MSEK 2,795 (2,575), equaling a year-on-year growthof 9% (5% in constant currencies)  · Net sales amounted to MSEK 2,574 (2,405), equaling a year-on-year growth of7% (4% in constant currencies)  · EBITA amounted to MSEK 120 (132) and the EBITA margin to 4.7% (5.5)  · IAC costs net amounted to MSEK -9 (-11)  · Operating profit (EBIT) amounted to MSEK 108 (110)  · Net profit for the period amounted to MSEK 31 (42)  · Earnings per share amounted to SEK 0.41 (0.56)  · Free cash flow amounted to MSEK 21 (-24) Full report is attached to this press release.Invitation to Telephone Conference on 19 July 09.30 (CET)To participate in the conference call, please dial in to one of these numbers:+46 8 5055 8358+44 33 3300 9274Agenda for the Telephone Conference09:25  Call in09:30  Review of the interim report by Gunnebo’s President and CEO, HenrikLange, and CFO, Susanne Larsson09:55  Questions and answers10:15  Closing of telephone conferenceCopies of the presentation will be available latest 30 minutes prior to thetelephone conference on www.gunnebogroup.com.

Organic growth was a negative 4 percent.  · EBITA increased to SEK 232 million and the EBITA margin increased to7.3 percent. EBITA increased to SEK 226 million (220) and the EBITA marginincreased to 7.2 percent (7.1) excluding IFRS 16.  · Operating EBITA amounted to SEK 232 million and the operating EBITA marginwas 7.3 percent. Operating EBITA amounted to SEK 226 million (240) and theoperating EBITA margin was 7.2 percent (7.7) excluding IFRS 16.  · Earnings per share before dilution amounted to SEK 2.63 (2.85).The CEO comments:""During the second quarter of 2019, we continued to deliver robust earnings witha strengthened margin and improved cash flow, despite a challenging market forwindows in Sweden and Finland.  Compared with the corresponding period in thepreceding year, net sales decreased by 1 percent over the quarter toSEK 1,710 million (1,729). Despite the lower sales, operating EBITA increased toSEK 187 million (184) over the quarter. This led to an increasing operatingEBITA margin to 10.9 percent (10.6), mainly due to our early cost savingsinitiatives and a generally more favourable mix, with Consumer sales on par withthe preceding year and a decline in Industry sales. Our combined assessment isthat we are, on the whole, continuing to capture market shares in the Nordicmarket.Continued favourable development in South, weaker in NorthBusiness area South continued to develop positively during the quarter, mainlydue to favourable development among our units in Denmark and the UK, the latterin a weak UK window market. Business area South’s sales increased by 6 percentand its operating EBITA rose to SEK 115 million (99), meaning that the operatingEBITA margin rose to 16.7 percent (15.2). The positive trend we have seen in e-Commerce over several quarters continued, with organic sales growth of7 percent. At the end of the quarter, business area South’s order backlog was19 percent higher than at the same time in the preceding year.During the period, development in business area North was weaker, due primarilyto a negative trend in the Industry markets in Sweden and Finland, which mainlyaffected our larger units in those markets. In Sweden, the overall market forwindows has gradually shrunk since the second half of 2018 and, in ourassessment, this weakening continued in the second quarter of 2019, in pace witha continued decline in new construction. However, conditions appear more stablein Inwido’s key Consumer segment, and in Norway. Our cost savings initiativeshave helped offset the decline in volumes. Overall, this resulted in sales forthe quarter decreasing by 6 percent, while operating EBITA decreased toSEK 76 million (99), meaning that the operating EBITA margin landed at7.8 percent (9.6). Business area North’s order backlog was 14 percent lower thanat the same time in the preceding year.Improved cash flow and reduced debtOur long-term acquisition strategy stands firm and our efforts to furtherstrengthen the balance sheet to be able to make acquisitions continue. Duringthe first half of the year, operating cash flow was positive in the amount ofSEK 213 million, compared with a negative development of SEK 6 million in thecorresponding period in the preceding year, bringing the net debt/EBITDA ratioat the end of the quarter to 2.8, excluding IFRS 16, compared with 12 monthsearlier when the ratio was 3.2. This means we are gradually approaching theGroup’s net debt/EBITDA target of 2.5.Future prospectsThe Industry market in both Sweden and Finland is showing few signs of recovery,with expectations of a continued decline in new construction activity. TheConsumer markets appear more stable, but are difficult to assess, partly due topolitical uncertainty. The conditions in the Danish and Norwegian marketscontinue to appear favourable, while we are seeing continued growth in the e-commerce segment and there is, on the whole, an underlying need for housinginvestment in our markets, as well as increased interest in such investment.We believe we are well positioned to meet the conditions imposed on us bymarkets and customers, and we look forward with confidence to the second half of2019.""MALMÖ – 15 JULY 2019Henrik HjalmarssonPresident and CEORead the full report in the pdf attachedFor more information, please contact:Inwido ABHenrik Hjalmarsson, President and CEO Tel.: 46 (0)76 846 20 46Peter Welin, CFO Phone: 46(0)70-324 3190 or 46(0)10-451 45 52 E-mail:peter.welin@inwido.comAbout InwidoInwido owns and develops companies that improve people’s everyday lives indoorswith various products and services.

Good organic growth of 12 percent generated excellentearnings growth and stronger margins. All of the business areas hold favourablepositions and continue to experience good market conditions. In particular, wehave succeeded to take good positions in segments with continuously very goodgrowth. In some areas, however, we are now experiencing that the strong tailwindhas abated.Market development – varying circumstancesThe business climate has been favourable in most customer segments andgeographies, while the circumstances in the market have more clearly begun tovary. In particular, demand for production components for the mechanicalindustry has shown signs of evening out at a high level, as has demand in thespecial vehicles segment. A partial explanation for this is the long lead timespreviously occurring for certain components. These leadtimes were reduced inearly 2019, resulting in decreased demand during the quarter, despite ofcontinued high production rate.The marine segment has continued to grow strongly, and accounts for just overhalf of the Group’s organic growth in the first quarter. Demand for our productsand services regarding environmental improvement solutions, has been very strongand is now expected to remain at this high level for at least the remainder ofthe financial year.From a geographical perspective, our best market situation was in Norway andFinland. Our sales in Sweden and Denmark were stable and our operations outsidethe Nordic region continued to perform well. However, our units in the UKcontinue to experience some uncertainty due to Brexit.AcquisitionsWe acquired five companies during the quarter, together contributing annualsales of about SEK 530 million. With our sound finances and strong pipeline witha favourable spread in terms of both on geography and segments, we see goodopportunities for further acquisitions.Outlook – continued focus on development areasOur business model, with a mix of trade products, customised products andsolutions and proprietary brands, represents a very important part of oursuccess. This mix affords us flexibility with regard to customers’ needs anddecreases our risks. In recent years, we have seen a shift in this mix. As shownin the model presented in our recently published annual report for the 2018/2019financial year, our proprietary products and customised solutions now accountfor approximately 65 percent of our business, while 35 percent consists of tradeproducts. Trade products will always be an important part of our business. Atthe same time, the trend confirms that we are really succeeding in addingincreasing value for our customers and that our investments in proprietaryproducts and brands have been successful.Looking ahead, we generally expect demand to persist, although evening out at ahigh level. External uncertainty affects us as it does everyone else, although,in the longer-term perspective, we still perceive many business opportunitieswithin structurally driven areas of development such as the environment andclimate, infrastructure and Industry 4.0.Stockholm, 12 July 2019Niklas StenbergPresident and CEOThis information is information that Addtech AB (publ) is obliged to make publicpursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Securities Markets Act.

Organicpro forma growth1) for the quarter amounted to 1.0%, despite fewer days ofsales.Restrictions on the use of single-use products made of plastic are now in thepipeline in many countries. Duni is positive about these important activitiesfor the environment and it is well in line with our new strategy where weincrease our focus on sustainability and see a very positive growth insustainable packaging.In addition to the positive sales development of sustainable packaging, we alsosee solid growth in premium napkins, while the table covers continue to developnegatively.The trend for our geographic growth areas has carried over from the previousquarter. This means that we are growing in most regions with particularly highgrowth in Australia, our second largest country in terms of sales.Margin program contributes to all-time-high incomeOperating income for the quarter was SEK 111 m (96), which is an all-time highfor Q2. We are seeing positive effects from our margin program which includedprice increases, to compensate for the significant rise in pulp prices, as wellas indirect expense savings. Nevertheless, we humbly note that we benefittedfrom important external factors such as falling pulp prices and the weakenedSwedish krona in the quarter. However, increased freight prices had a negativeimpact on our income.Performance in our business areasTaking a look at our business areas, Meal Service and New Markets saw positivegrowth in both sales and income and Table Top’s performance was steady whileBusiness Area Consumer continues to have a weak performance. Organic pro formagrowth1) amounted to 6% in Meal Service and 14% in New Markets, but Consumer hada negative sales development of 15% at fixed exchange rates. Our price increasesin 2018 resulted in a loss of some high volumes contracts within Consumer. Toboost our future competitiveness in the business area, we are now engaging inactivities aiming to raise efficiency in the value chain.Pulp prices continue to fallPulp prices continued to decline in the second quarter.

Traffic is scheduled to start in June 2020 andinvolves a total of 70 scheduled buses.  · Nobina was awarded two new contracts by HSL for city transport in Helsinki,Finland which together comprise 34 scheduled buses with a total contract valueof approximately EUR 50 million. By securing the contracts, Nobina will nowoperate five electric buses in Helsinki.  · Nobina secured two contracts, whereof one new, for city and regionaltransport throughout Halland, Sweden to develop public transport together withHallandstrafiken. The agreements will involve 127 scheduled buses and have acontract value of approximately SEK 3 billion. The services will be launched on15 June 2020 and the contracts will run for ten years without an optionalextension period.  · Nobina was awarded a contract by Piteå Municipality to operate and developcity transport in Piteå, Sweden. The contract, which will launch in July 2020,involves 12 scheduled buses and extends over ten years and has a total value ofSEK 250 million.  · The 2018/2019 AGM approved the Board’s proposed dividend of SEK 3.80 pershare, and a resolution was taken to introduce a performance-based share savingscheme for 60 key employees. Johan Bygge was elected new director and DeputyChairman.  · Nobina appointed Pernilla Walfridsson as new CFO of Nobina AB and member ofGroup management. Pernilla will succeed Per Skärgård, who will retire on 31October 2019 following 15 years as CFO of Nobina.Significant events after the end of the quarter  ·  No significant events occurred after the end of the quarter.The financial information presented in the report pertains to continuingoperations, unless otherwise stated. The divestment of Swebus Express AB wasreported pursuant to IFRS 5 and is therefore adjusted in the current and thecomparative periods and recognised at an aggregate amount under the line item“profit/loss from discontinued operations” in the consolidated income statement.CEO’s commentsWe have had a strong start to the new fiscal year. Higher sales supported byorganic growth, underlying earnings improvements in the contract portfolio andcontributions from previous acquisitions yielded an adjusted profit before taxof SEK 113 million (71) for the first quarter. In Sweden, performance wasparticularly strong in Skåne and the Stockholm region. In Denmark, theacquisition of De Blaa Omnibusser and Örslev Holding contributed to sales growthand stronger earnings, and in Finland we further improved underlyingprofitability through continuing efficiency enhancements. However, in Norwayearnings slowed partly due to the start-up of new contracts.After the recent year’s strong earnings trend, which continues into this year,we will see somewhat more challenging comparables in the second half of the yeardue to extensive contract migration. However, the effects of contract migrationwill be less due to the underlying strengthening of the quality of the contractportfolio, since certain poorer performing contracts like Tromsö expire.Profitability in new contracts is always at its lowest early in the contractperiod, and then gradually improves to be the highest at the end.As we place stringent demands on which contracts we want to win, it is at thesame time positive for long-term profitability that we can continue to grow. Thefirst quarter was successful in a business context. We have defended andexpanded our responsibility for operating and developing public transportthroughout Halland as well as in Bollebygd and Kinna in Västra Götaland, throughcontracts with a total value of SEK 4.6 billion. We have also extendedcollaboration with HSL in the Helsinki region and won a contract to develop citytransport in Piteå. Taken together, the contracts secured during the quartermean we have increased our market shares and long-term growth. Tender volumesare also extensive during the rest of the year, particularly in Sweden andNorway. As few of our own contracts are expiring, we have the right conditionsto add further shares in a market that is attractive in the long term.We are also expanding within existing contracts, where greater responsibilityfor transport solutions is providing new business opportunities. This includes,for example, solutions for Mobility as a Service (MaaS), meaning digitalservices that simplify travel from door-to-door. MaaS is one important elementin developing complete solutions for public transport, where we collaborate withclients and other stakeholders to develop entire cities and districts in asustainable manner. Our commitment in Barkarbystaden is one excellent example ofthis and has become an international role model. Our autonomous buses in regularservice were lauded in April at Tech.AD Award in Berlin, the leading Europeanevent for autonomous technology. At the world’s largest public transport event,Global Public Transportation Summit, which was held in Stockholm in June, ourbus solutions in Barkarbystaden were of course included in discussions.Complete solutions for increased comfort in urban areas, fossil-free fuel, newtechnology that eliminates harmful emissions and a great commitment forintegration and gender equality, form part of our responsibility to deliversustainable solutions to society and in meeting major challenges. You can readmore about how we work with this, and how this is driving our profitability andgrowth, in our annual report and corporate presentation, which is available onour website. In cooperation with Telia, we have developed an IoT solution forsmarter heating of our buses. It was launched in June and contributes toextensive energy savings and a more comfortable climate in the buses. Theproceeds from the green bond of SEK 500 million we issued in February are nowcompletely reserved for purchasing new electric-powered buses and buses thatoperate on fossil-free fuel. We, as the largest electric bus operator in theNordics, currently have orders for more than 100 electric buses, which means ourelectric bus fleet will triple within one year.In summary, I can look back on a strong start to the new fiscal year. Our salesand earnings are increasing, we are winning new contracts and our business isgrowing within existing contracts, and the integration of previous acquisitionsis progressing as planned. The earnings impact from imminent major start-ups andterminations should be viewed on the basis of Nobina’s long-term strongunderlying earnings capacity and growing business volume.Magnus Rosén,President and CEOThe information comprises such as Nobina AB (publ) is obliged to publiclydisclose pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Securities MarketAct.

(IEP), IES acquired 99.4% of the shares in ColegioInternacional de Valladolid, a school fee-funded private school in Valladolid,Spain, with 294 studentsCEO’s commentIMPROVED PROFITABILITYThe third quarter showed continued strong growth, up 17.5% year-on-year, due toacquisitions in Spain and more students in Sweden. The margin also improved dueto a better balance between the increase in school voucher funding and teachersalaries, respectively. At the same time, we can see that our efforts to appealincorrect school voucher decisions are yielding results. We are continuing togrow in Spain through acquisitions and as planned, the operations developedfavourably.Strong third quarterOur third quarter was characterised by strong growth and improved profitability.In addition, the final school voucher decisions for 2019 were slightly betterthan the preliminary decisions we received and rose by just over 3% comparedwith 2018.Operating income for the July to March period increased by 16.6% to MSEK2,024.7, of which organic growth amounted to 10.0%. The operating margin (EBIT)adjusted for costs affecting comparability related to the CEO change in Januarywas 7.1% (7.3).For the second consecutive quarter, we can see that teacher salary increaseshave levelled out while school voucher increases better reflect the costs. Wehave been working with municipalities for several years to ensure that theschool vouchers we receive are correct, which has also led to retroactivepayments from some municipalities. In Sweden, revenues per student rose 3.0% inthe first nine months, while personnel costs per student, adjusted for itemsaffecting comparability, rose 4.3%.Research supports bilingual educationIES has provided bilingual education since 1993 based on the belief that Englishis the key that gives our students access to the whole world. In today’sglobalised world, it is more relevant than ever to have full command of English,while Swedish is vital for participation in the Swedish labour market andculture.However, the benefits of bilingual education are far greater. More and morestudies are showing that bilingualism improves cognitive abilities, such asworking memory and the ability to focus and reason. A research study onbilingualism by Naja Ferjan Ramirez and Patricia Kuhl published in 2017 showsthat children who are bilingual perform as well and even better than monolingualchildren. The study also shows that exposure to a second language at an earlyage through social interactions is more effective than learning a language fromTV and other media. Bilingualism also develops proficiency in Swedish. In hisresearch, Per Holmberg shows that students with both English and Swedish astheir languages of instruction, improve the most in Swedish.Continued growthIn Sweden, we now have nearly 200,000 registrations in the queue for ourschools. More and more parents are seeing the benefits of how we manage andoperate our schools. In Spain, where we have a total of 2,800 students in ourschools following our recent acquisition in early April, the demand foreducation in Spanish and English is high from Spanish families. Combined withthe positive trend for our existing schools, this means that we are constantlyevaluating new acquisition opportunities in Spain. In Sweden, more and moremunicipalities want us to establish in their areas. However, because schoolvoucher funding does not always reflect the real cost of, for example premises,we are forced to decline on a regular basis. As the number of school-agechildren increases, so does the need for new – and costly – school buildings,which is pushing rent levels up. However, our plan to open two to three newschools in Sweden per year remains firm.Taking care of nearly 29,000 schoolchildren between 5-19 years is a hugeresponsibility and requires totally dedicated, committed and enthusiasticemployees. Our fantastic principals, teachers and other employees go the extramile every day to ensure that every child can reach their potential. The moreschools I visit, the clearer it becomes that this is the foundation ofintegration and sustainable social development.Cecilia MarlowInterim CEOFOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT:Emma Rheborg, Head of Communication & IR, tel. +46 (0)768-511 540Cecilia Marlow, Interim CEO, tel. +46 (0)73-414 61 28Fredrik Åkerman, CFO, tel. +46 (0)70-415 23 65TELECONFERENCE IN CONNECTION WITH PUBLICATION OF THE QUARTERLY REPORT:Interim CEO Cecilia Marlow and CFO Fredrik Åkerman will be holding ateleconference today, Friday 17 May, at 10:00 a.m. CEST in connection withpublication of the quarterly report.

It is gratifying thatgrowth is broad, driven mainly by a robust expansion in E-mobility (previouslycalled EV charging) but also in our base – Electrical distribution products.Growth is strong in both of our business areas. Sweden displayed growth of 18%,and Other markets 24%. It should be noted that the first quarter last year wasweak in Electrical distribution products because of the harsh winter.EBIT for the quarter rose 16% to MSEK 29.2, corresponding to an EBIT margin of11.7% (12.1). Adjusted for a reserve of MSEK 4.0 included in the results(related to severance pay for the previous CEO), the EBIT margin amounted to13.5%, a result of the healthy volume growth in combination with efficient costcontrol.HIGH MARKET PRESENCEA forward-looking product development must go hand-in-hand with a strongmarketing and sales organization. We have made investments in these areasthrough strengthening the sales organization with several new recruits. We havehad a high market presence during the period. For example, we participated inHanover Fairground, one of the world’s largest industry trade fairs, and severaltrade fairs in the UK with a focus on charger products. Marketing initiativeshave been taken in the Nordic region and northern Europe, which is in line withour strategy to grow in these regions in the coming years.E-MOBILITY GROWTHS WITH 89%The E-mobility product area continues to demonstrate increased growth. Duringthe quarter, several major projects in the product area were delivered, and wehave received feedback from several customers who value that GARO was able todeliver quickly. This is a result of continuously building up and significantlyexpanding our delivery capacity, accomplished primarily through investments inour Polish factory as well as an increased capacity in the sub-supplier chain.Product development in E-mobility is continuous, with new functionality andbetter performance, and interest in our products remains strong in all markets.MARKET CONDITIONSDemand for construction-related products in Sweden is good but is expected togradually slow in 2019, as a reduced number of construction starts. However, therenovation sector has been deemed stable. The trend in other markets served byGARO is expected to remain favorable.

European Lingerie Group AB,2019-05-15 12:33:00,"European Lingerie Group AB (ELG or the “Group”) publishes unaudited FirstQuarter Report for 2019 (January 1 – March 31, 2019), including pro forma andcondensed interim financial statements.”In 2019, the Group’s new product lines, including our new brand Senselle byFelina and also Felina swimwear, have started bringing good volumes. The salesresults of the first quarter of 2019 were satisfactory and for the secondquarter in a row the Group demonstrated the sales growth. The contribution ofthese new products to total sales will continue with increasing pace throughoutthe whole year,” commented CEO of ELG, Mr. Peter Partma.”Unfortunately, the continuing trend of the overall change of retail concept inSouthern and Central Europe and slowdown of macroeconomy in most Europeanmarkets will limit our potential growth to some extent,” added Mr. Partma.”On the production side, we continue investing in our manufacturing base inorder to improve the quality of our products as well as to be able to offerbetter and new materials to our customers. The result of these investments willgradually convert into the cost savings and profit margin improvement startingfrom the second half of this year,” noted Mr. Partma.In January 2019, the Group acquired Yustina OOO (later renamed to Senselle OOO),a lingerie ready garment producer in Belarus. This acquisition is part of ELGstrategy to expand its operations and add capacity for private label andSenselle by Felina brand production.In January 2019, the Group also established a new subsidiary Brafetch GmbH andin March 2019 Brafetch GmbH established a new subsidiary SistersOf ProductionSIA. Both companies will be involved in the implementation of the omni-channelstrategy of the Group and launching of a new lingerie Marketplace.The bonds issued by European Lingerie Group AB were approved for listing onNasdaq Stockholm Corporate Bond list in December 2018 and are traded since 2January 2019.On the profitability side, the Group’s Management is fully focused that ELGcomplies with the bond covenant’s requirements and several improvement steps arein the implementation process.Financial performance of the Group was analysed on the basis of the reportedfinancial information of European Lingerie Group AB for Q1 2019 as well as proforma financial information for Q1 2018.The Group’s sales amounted to EUR 21,022 thousand in Q1 2019 (Q1 2018: EUR19,357 thousand), representing an 8.6% increase as compared to pro forma salesof Q1 2018. In Q1 2019, the growth in sales was achieved by sales of new productlines, i.e. Senselle by Felina lingerie and Felina swimwear, as well as thegeneral increase of orders from traditional customers in the textile segment.Profitability margins in Q1 2019 are generally comparable to those of Q1 2018while starting to demonstrate an increasing trend. The slight improvement inmargins is a result of contribution earned on additional sales. The profitimprovement effect, though, is not significant due to the general cost inflationstill faced in important cost categories and the effect of additional costsinvested in marketing to promote the new products just launched and in productdevelopment to deliver further novelties to the market.Normalised EBITDA in Q1 2019 amounted to EUR 2,684 thousand (Q1 2018: EUR 2,417thousand) and increased by 11.0% compared to pro forma normalised EBITDA in Q12018. Normalised EBITDA margin in Q1 2019 and Q1 2018 were 12.8% and 12.5%respectively.Normalised net profit in Q1 2019 amounted to EUR 318 thousand, compared to proforma normalised net profit of EUR 29 thousand in Q1 2018. Normalised net profitmargin in Q1 2019 and Q1 2018 were 1.5% and 0.1%.Core operating markets for European Lingerie Group are Germany, Spain, France,Poland, Benelux countries, Baltic countries, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. TheGroup’s sales in its core markets in Q1 2019 were 79.5% of its total salesagainst 83.0% in Q1 2018. Decrease in core markets is explained by adiversification of the Group to other markets and growth of its sales there. Q12019 demonstrated a growth in Morocco, Italy, Austria and other EU countries.The largest growth in sales in Q1 2019 was in Russia and Belarus. These marketsgrew by 97.5% and 18.0% respectively in Q1 2019. Sales in Russia in Q1 2018 werevery limited due to postponement of orders by two largest Felina and Conturelledistributors in Russia. 2019, in turn, did not have extraordinary circumstancesthus, the sales were at a normal level with the growing trend. Russia is alsoone of the main customers for Felina swimwear and Senselle by Felina lingerieready garments, which pushed the sales up even further. Sales in Belarus grew inthe textile segment of the Group and were a result of the growth of medium sizelingerie sewing companies in the country.Spain and Poland also delivered sizeable growth in the first quarter, wherebysales in these countries in Q1 2019 increased by 6.2% and 4.7% respectively.This is a result of several activities including development of the omni-channelstrategy with the largest customer in Spain as well as the expansion of ELGlingerie products’ presence in the retail channels in these countries. Spain isanother important market for Felina swimwear, which helped to grow salesfurther.Sales in Germany, France and Benelux decreased by 8.3%, 20.5% and 7.5%respectively due to the slowdown of the European macroeconomy and blockedpotential growth. The balance of sales growth vs margin is still the main issuein France in the current and the coming periods. ELG’s main competitors in theregion continue suffering and try to improve their sales by reducing prices andoffering higher discounts to customers not only for previous season collections,but also for novelties. In part of these cases the Group does not follow thegeneral price trend and chooses to better sell less, but at better margin.Sales in the Baltic countries reduced by 1.5% in Q1 2019 and it related to thetextile segment of the Group. Most of the Baltic customers of the Group sufferedfrom changes in the importing rules into Russia and as a result, did not havequick enough capital turn to continue ordering raw materials.Sales in Ukraine dropped by 24.2% in Q1 2019, but there was no particular reasonfor that. One of the largest customers of the Group in the textile segment inUkraine orders its raw materials only 4 times a year and Q1 2019 was inside thelow order period. The Group expects the sales deficit to reduce throughout theyear.European Lingerie Group AB First Quarter Report of 2018 is available here (https://www.elg-corporate.com/uploads/2019/05/ELG_Q1_2019_report_FINAL.pdf)andthe presentation of the report here (https://www.elg-corporate.com/uploads/2019/05/ELG_Q1_2019_presentation_FINAL.pdf%20).European Lingerie Group AB investor’s phone conference on Q1 2019 results isheld on May 17, 2019 at 14.00 CET.

Customer satisfaction remainshigh as well as the True Frequency continues to rise, which combined with acontinued new customer-intake at a high level, confirms our strong momentum. Theaverage order value was down driven by higher returns in the first quarter.However, gross average order value was unchanged compared to last year as lowerpricing levels were offset by an increase in items per basket driven by stronggrowth in the newer categories. Over the last 12 months the average order valueand the return rate has been at a stable level, but we will closely monitor thedevelopment of these in the coming period.”“The gross margin remained under pressure from the general industry trading ofexcess stock from the Autumn Winter 18 season. This spill over effect from lastyear could only be partly offset by our increased level of campaign stockresulting in a gross margin 1.3%-points lower than last year. The operating costratios were negatively impacted be the lower average order value, partly offsetby lower customer acquisition costs leading to SEK 7 million lower adjusted EBITcompared to last year, half of which was related to our physical beauty store inCopenhagen.”“Our categories, especially Sport and Beauty, continue their strong growth, andI am very excited to see the development of our online outlet Booztlet.com.

Contributing reasons for growthof net sales are new client wins and the fact that we generally win morebusiness than we lose.Due to the changes in the client portfolio and linked changes in the product mixour gross margin declined to 21.5% and the growth of gross profit was thereforesmaller than the growth in net sales.Costs are on the same level as recent quarters but lower than in Q1 2018 whichresults in an EBITDA of SEK 13 M and an improved EBITDA margin of 4.3%.

SSM Holding AB,2019-05-15 07:00:00,"In accordance with Nasdaq’s recommendations, from Q4 2018, and retroactively,SSM applies the completed contract method for reporting cooperative apartmentprojects.Summary of January – March 2019  · Net sales for projects run entirely by SSM totaled 15.4 MSEK (225.5).  · Operating loss was -12.4 MSEK (34.7).  · Cash flow from operating activities amounted to -33.7 MSEK (-88.6).  · 27 (6) pre-purchase agreements were signed. 6 (0) agreements were cancelleddue to changes within the Bromma Boardwalk project.  · The Stockholm City Planning Committee decided to continue planning forTellus Towers. Consultations are planned to the third and fourth quarters 2019.  · The Clustret project in Jakobsberg, which has 200 building rights, wasterminated due to a significant change in the municipality’s planning work.  · A cost-efficiency program was introduced to reduce overhead costs by 50.0percent, or 25.0 MSEK, in 2019.There were no significant events after the balance sheet dateMattias Roos, President & CEO, comments on the first quarter:“The sales of cooperative apartments, especially those within new production,remain cautious even if there has been a certain stabilization in the market.Earlier in the year, we launched over 100 redesigned, smart and affordable homesin the Elverket Nacka and Täby Market projects, most of which are priced under2.0 MSEK. The aim going forward is for 70.0 percent of our cooperativeapartments for sale to be priced under 2.0 MSEK. During the quarter, we sold 27cooperative apartments and at the end of the quarter, the company’s salesrate in ongoing production was 96.6 percent.The quarter’s operating loss was -12.4 MSEK (34.7) due to fewer cooperativeapartments where revenue was recognized and lower revenue from contractingoperations. From the third quarter of 2019, profit recognition will commence forWest Side Solna project. To increase profitability in the near future, a cost-efficiency program has been initiated to cut the company’s overhead costs by 50percent to about 25.0 MSEK in 2019.SSM’s flexible project portfolio was a strength for the company when the marketfor new production of cooperative apartments slowed in the second half of 2017.Today, nearly half of our projects are rentals. The rental unit business hasstrong potential due to the conversions of rental units to cooperativeapartments in the last ten years and conversions planned by municipal housingcompanies. There is significant interest from investors in our rental projectsand in the next two years, we expect good growth within this product area.I believe that with our housing concept and attractive project portfolio, SSM iscorrectly positioned for good growth and value creation over time.

Troax Group AB,2019-05-14 12:30:00,"Hillerstorp 14th of May 2019, 12:30 CETJANUARY – MARCH  ·  Order intake decreased by 1 per cent to 39,7 (40,3) MEUR. Adjusted forcurrency the decrease was 1 per cent.  ·  Sales increased by 6 per cent to 39,1 (36,7) MEUR. Adjusted for currencythe increase was 6 per cent.  ·  Operating profit decreased to 5,9 (6,5) MEUR.  ·  Operating margin decreased to 15,1 (17,1) per cent.  ·  Financial net was -0,3 (-0,3) MEUR.  ·  Profit after tax decreased to 4,3 (4,6) MEUR.  ·  Earnings per share after dilution decreased to 0,22 (0,23) EUR.CEOCOMMENTSAfter a comparatively strong last quarter of 2018, the Group started slightlyweaker in 2019. The first quarter had an order intake slightly lower than theprevious year. Only the Nordic region grew in value. The market has beencharacterized by a sideways movement and has not increased during the quarter.Order intake remains at a high level, but with longer decision times from ourcustomers. We have again received several important orders from customers inautomation, warehousing and property but have during this quarter noted a loweractivity on larger projects within warehouses, which has not previously been thecase. Our assessment is that this lower activity is short-term and will increaseagain later in the year. The previously reported lower activity in theautomotive industry has not changed during the first quarter. In terms of orderintake, this is most pronounced in the North American operations, which duringthe first quarter had a significantly lower order volume from the automotiveindustry. We are still devoting a great deal of time and effort into theintegration and improvement of our Folding Guard unit in Chicago. We can onceagain conclude that it takes longer than expected to change the culture andattitude towards customer requirements, but that we now see positive changes,and we can concentrate on increasing the efforts in marketing and sales. Thishas been manifested during the quarter in a new initiative and re-profiling ofthe brand and a clearly increased activity towards new and old customers. Afterthe end of the period, an important trade fair was held in the USA where ourconcept and market orientation were well received by customers. We can also notethat the quote level for the company is clearly better than the previous year atthe end of the quarter, but that order intake and also earnings have still beenweak. The market in the US has been good during the first quarter and we can seea good development for our sales under the Troax brand. Our assessment is thatduring this quarter the market has been stable, possibly slightly declining incertain geographic markets. The indication is still that most customers havewell-filled order books and the activity level has been high, but that, like thefourth quarter last year, market growth has levelled out to a continued highlevel. The development for the Group has been below the historical average andis not at a desired level. However, the order backlog at the end of the periodremains at a good level.During the fourth quarter of 2018, we started the production of Troax productsin our factory in Chicago. This has been welcomed by many customers. We are alsoin the final phase of investing in a completely new mesh panel production lineat the Group's main unit in Hillerstorp. This production line is nowmanufacturing and is expected to reach full speed during the second quarter of2019.Net sales increased by 6 percent in the quarter compared with the correspondingperiod last year. The development is positive especially in the UK and in theNordic region. The result for the quarter is lower than in the previous year, assome increased price competition on certain parts of the Group's product rangewas noted. A certain negative product mix has also been noted, as several largerprojects in the warehouse sector were invoiced during the period. We haveincreased sales and marketing costs according to plan, which together with thelower gross margin, resulted in a lower operating margin compared with theprevious year. We still have good capacity utilization in our facilities inHillerstorp, Sweden and Calco, Italy. During the period, a certain increase ininventories in the UK was made as a result of the uncertainty surroundingBrexit. In total for the Group, the operating margin was 15,1 per cent comparedwith 17,7 the previous year. The consolidation of Folding Guard continues toadversely affect the Group's operating margin. However, we still see goodopportunities to increase the margin for Folding Guard in the long term. Netprofit amounted to MEUR 4,3 for the quarter, compared to MEUR 4,6 last year. Thedecline is mainly attributable to lower operating profit. Earnings per share forthe first quarter are EUR 0,22 compared with EUR 0,23 in the correspondingquarter of 2018. Working capital is at the expected level. The balance sheetitem '' tangible assets' has increased by approximately EUR 6,9 million due toreporting in accordance with IFRS 16. Cash flow during the quarter is lower thanthe same period in 2018, due to lower earnings and somewhat higher capital tiedup in accounts receivable. Investments were charged EUR 1,5 million in cash flowin the quarter. The key figure for net borrowing in relation to EBITDA is now1,2 which is clearly below the Group's target.Thomas Widstrand, President and CEOTELEPHONE CONFERENCEInvitation to presentation of the first quarter result:Thomas Widstrand, CEO presents the result on a phone conference on the 14th ofMay 2019 at 17:00 CET.

Contingent on the Annual General Meeting’sapproval of a new Board of Directors, and approval from the new Board, AnnaLjung has been proposed as the new CEO of Moberg Pharma.STATEMENT FROM THE CEOThe divestment of our OTC business represents a major change for Moberg Pharmaand allows shareholders to recognize a compelling value for both components ofthe business. Since April 1, 2019, Moberg Pharma has a fully funded businesswhose main goal is to make MOB-015 the future market leader in onychomycosis.My final report as CEO follows a very eventful quarter that concluded a phase inthe company’s history. Recently, we successfully divested the OTC business,which we had built up and refined since 2006. Instead we are in the near termfully focused on the development and commercialization of new pharmaceuticalproducts. The transaction provided a capital gain of 556 MSEK after transactionscosts, and the effect on the total profit was 502 MSEK, enabled us to repay theentire bond loan and to make a distribution to the shareholders of approximatelySEK 43–45 per share planned for November 2019. We retain the upside of theremaining, fully financed business, focusing on MOB-015, whose potential alonesubstantially exceeds the value of the divested portfolio.Continued focus on the USThe US will remain Moberg Pharma’s most important market going forward, but thistime with an emphasis on the much larger prescription market for nail fungustreatment. The commercialization plans for MOB-015 comprise a combination ofdirect sales and co-marketing with partners focused on the US, as well as out-licensing to other markets such as the EU, Japan, Canada and China – all withpatent protection until 2032. Two attractive license agreements for MOB-015 arealready in place in Canada (Cipher) and Europe (Bayer), and we look forward toadding exciting collaborations in the future. The agreement with Bayer wassigned in the first quarter, and the partnership with this leader in OTC fungaltreatments is an important proof of the large potential for MOB-015.A new organization under new leadershipSince April 1, the organization has its sights set on the development,registration and commercialization of the future market leader in treatment ofonychomycosis. It is a journey we have already made with Kerasal Nail and one wenow intend to repeat with MOB-015 – this time under the leadership of AnnaLjung, the proposed CEO and the CFO of the company since our start. With the newmanagement team that was recently presented, the organization is well-staffedfor the challenges that await. After thirteen intensive and rewarding years asCEO and after the OTC divestment, Moberg Pharma is now entering a new stage andit is a logical time for a new management to take over. I will be continuing tosupport the business based on the company’s new needs, in areas such as businessdevelopment in and outside the US and in investor relations.My sincere thanksI would again like to thank both current and former employees, without whosevaluable efforts none of this would have been possible. You are simplyfantastic! I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to our shareholdersand the Board of Directors, who have supported us on this exciting and eventfuljourney and continue to stand behind us in the next stage as we are aiming tocreate the future market leader in nail fungus. Next on the agenda is theelection of a new Board of Directors at the Annual General Meeting. The nextmilestone will be the first interim results from the Phase 3 program for MOB-015, which are expected later this year, in parallel with continuedcommercialization preparations.

Hoist Finance AB,2019-05-14 07:30:00,"Strong earningsJanuary – March 2019  · Total operating income increased 13 per cent to SEK 774m (684).  · Profit before tax increased 22 per cent to SEK 226m (185).  · Diluted earnings per share amounted to SEK 1.79 (1.59).  · Return on equity was 17 per cent (18).  · Carrying value of acquired loan portfolios totalled SEK 21,115m (20,605).  · The total capital ratio was 13.70 per cent (14.14) and the CET1 capitalratio was 9.47 per cent (9.66).Figures in brackets refer to first quarter 2018 for profit/loss comparisons andto the closing balance at 31 December 2018 for balance sheet items.Events during the quarter  · Continued harmonisation of work methods and organisation in accordance withthe One Hoist Finance model, with Hoist Finance France restructured fromsubsidiary to branch office.  · Customer portal 2.0 implemented in France and FICO collection systemimplemented in Germany.  · Changes to senior management: Emanuele Reale is new Chief Operating Officerand Fabien Klecha is new Chief Sales Officer.  · Establishment of two Centres of Excellence (one for secured assets and onefor unsecured assets) to ensure knowledge transfer and process harmonisation andstandardisation across markets.  · Good progress on our mitigating actions to address regulatory changes.Subsequent events  · Hoist Finance finalised the acquisition of assets totalling PLN 400m fromthe Polish debt restructuring company GetBack.  · Hoist Finance has won the auction to acquire the business of the Italiandebt collection companies Maran S.p.A. and R&S S.r.l. and the last steps of theprocess is expected to be finalised in the near future.Delivering on our strategyStrong earningsOne year ago, we established our strategy of capturing our lion share of themarket through expanding into new asset classes and to become the most efficientoperator in the industry. In the first quarter of 2019, I am very pleased to seethat we are delivering strong earnings and our best result ever. We did thisthrough continued strong collection performance (105 per cent) and an improvedcost to income ratio (71 per cent (74)). If we also include the acquisition ofthe GetBack portfolios in the first quarter, although this technically wasclosed late April, the investment level in the first quarter was the best startof the year ever for Hoist Finance.In the fourth quarter 2018 report, we discussed and explained the consequencesof new regulations and our mitigating actions. New regulation is one of the keytopics for the Credit Management Services industry, which is expected to remain.Hoist Finance welcomes regulations as these benefit our clients, customers andthe most professional companies in the industry. The new regulations will reducethe European banks’ Non Performing Exposures and increase the supply of Non-Performing Loans (NPL), which of course is a very positive trend. However,being regulated as a bank, the same regulations have negative consequences forHoist Finance that we are now addressing through implementing mitigatingactions.One of the key mitigating actions to address both increased risk weights as wellas the prudential NPL backstop is to securitise part of the NPLs. We have madesubstantial progress since year end and we are confident that we are on theright path towards a sustainable business model in a post NPL backstop world.Additionally, working with co-investors is another option for Hoist Finance inorder to continue creating shareholder value. We have co-investors working onpotential fund structure for a mid-size NPL portfolio. The potential transactionis in documentation and structuring phase where we aim to close by summer.The work to implement the most cost efficient mitigating actions and to optimisethe Hoist Finance business model based on the credit market license willcontinue, and we believe that the business model will remain both sustainableand competitive.In the first quarter we have won the auction to acquire the business of MaranGroup in Italy and the last steps of the process is expected to be finalised inthe near future, and a final agreement to acquire the GetBack portfolios wassigned late April. Both transactions strengthen our strategy of focusing on aselected number of markets in Europe.Strengths in Management and OrganisationAs communicated on 18 March 2019, I am happy to welcome Fabien Klecha, previouscountry manager for France, to my management team as our new Chief SalesOfficer. At the same time, our previous Chief Sales Office Emanuele Reale hasaccepted the role as Chief Operating Officer. With Emanuele and Fabien in theirnew roles, I am convinced that Hoist Finance now has a complete management teamwith the right competences to deliver on our goals.To strengthen the journey of operational efficiency, Hoist Finance has createdtwo centers of excellence, one for secured assets and one for unsecured assets.The purpose of these two centers of excellence is to ensure that the companyharmonises and standardises processes across markets and share best practices inan efficient way.OutlookThe market outlook is strong and the Credit Management Services industry iscreating value for shareholders, clients and customers.

Order intake andsales also grew strongly in SEK. In USD, sales growth for the Group was,however, slightly weaker than previous quarters, due to weaker order intake inthe fourth quarter of 2018. The rate of growth in order intake has, however,improved in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter.Nordic has continued to deliver good growth and strong earnings. Our Eastsegment also reported continued favorable results. Growth in Europe was slightlyweaker during this quarter, following a strong fourth quarter in 2018.It is taking longer than planned in North America to transition operations andeven if we are heading in the right direction progress is still slow. We havereduced the proportion of low-tech products as planned, but this decrease is yetto be fully compensated for, though we have secured many new customers who aredeveloping favourably. We have just got the news that the tariffs for importedgoods to USA have been raised from 10 to 25 percent from 10 May.The acquisition of Multiprint was completed in March and the integration isproceeding as planned. In Malaysia, where we launched operations three monthsago, we now have four employees who are building a base of new customers. We arealso launching operations in the Netherlands and have recruited a ManagingDirector, who will begin work at the end of June.Our annual conference, which was held in April in Athens, is an important meansof building and maintaining a strong culture. This year, we had 270participants, 40 more than last year. Our recently published sustainability andannual report describe the high level of motivation and engagement of ouremployees. The result of this year’s employee survey was even stronger than lastyear.

The Swedish market was the strongest performer, and Norway alsodeveloped positively. All sales channels had positive development, but newlending grew the most through loan brokers, which was a result of improvedcustomer processes and collaborations with more brokers.Mortgage loansNordax began offering mortgages in Sweden in 2018. The main target group iscustomers with some form of non-traditional employment, i.e. the self-employedor temporary employees, including project, part-time or replacement workers.Thorough credit assessments and personal contacts mean more loan approvals forthis customer group, which is often denied by the major banks despite stablefinances. The interest in the offer has been high and new lending has beenstable. At the end of the quarter,Nordax also began offering mortgage loans in the Norwegian market through loanbrokers. The plan is to begin accepting mortgage applications directly throughNordax’s website in the second quarter.Equity release mortgagesNew lending grew strongly in the quarter, more than doubling compared to thesame period in 2018. One contributing factor has been increased marketing, whichhas led to greater awareness of Svensk Hypotekspension (SHP) as a brand andequity release mortgages as a product. In addition, more applicants becameeligible for an equity release mortgage during the quarter after the lendinglimit was changed and the offer was extended to more of the country’smunicipalities.Portfolio developmentTotal lending amounted to SEK 20.9 billion (SEK 15.1 billion as of 31 December2018). The acquisition of SHP and a strong quarter in the Swedish market werethe most important reasons for the strong development, although all geographicalmarkets except Germany grew as well.

In our first launch market, Finland, an estimated 6% of patientswith opioid dependence are receiving Buvidal® after its first 3 months ofavailability. Subsequently, we have launched Buvidal® in the UK, Sweden, Germanyand Denmark, with a considerable interest in all markets and a positive responsefrom healthcare providers and patients.Positive start of EU launchFollowing the launch of Buvidal®, patients in the EU have access to the firstinnovative long-acting medication for the treatment of opioid dependence, withindividualized flexible weekly and monthly dosing. So far, around 500 patientshave initiated treatment with Buvidal®, including new-to-treatment patients, andpatients transferring from daily medication with sublingual buprenorphine andmethadone. The majority of these patients are from Finland and Germany, whileinitial patient uptake in the UK, Sweden and Denmark, has, as expected, beenless rapid due to the reimbursement and formulary listing processes. In Norwayand Australia, we have submitted pricing and reimbursement applications and areexpecting positive decisions and aim to start launches shortly thereafter.Initial sales of Buvidal® follows plan and with the positive feedback andengagement with stakeholders we are expecting to see significant growth duringthe year.Large interest in Buvidal® in the criminal justice settingAside from very positive signals from healthcare providers, we have also seen asignificant interest in our long-acting treatment solutions for use in custodialsettings, where the unmet medical need of a safe and effective treatmentalternative is significant. Several prisons in Germany have recently begun usingBuvidal® for the treatment of patients with opioid dependence, with theexpectation that our long-acting treatments will lead to improvement of outcomesand significant treatment efficiencies. Additionally, treatment with weekly andmonthly Buvidal® may facilitate the transition to outpatient treatmentprotecting patients from the known risks of overdose and death during the firstweeks of being released from prison. To further the understanding of thecontribution Buvidal® can make in custodial settings a clinical UNLOC-T studycomparing Buvidal® with methadone at eight prisons in New South Wales,Australia, is also progressing and initial results are expected in the fourthquarter of 2019. With a large unmet need and more than 100,000 individuals withopioid dependence in the EU and Australian prison systems combined, we seesignificant opportunities for Buvidal® in the criminal justice setting.In the first quarter of 2019 we completed enrollment in the DEBUT outpatientclinical study comparing Buvidal® with daily standard-of-care with sublingualbuprenorphine/naloxone. Results are expected during the fourth quarter.A detailed subgroup analysis of fentanyl users in the pivotal Phase 3 study ofBuvidal® compared to sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone was also conducted. Theresults, showing improved outcomes and less illicit opioid use in patientstreated with Buvidal®, were presented by Professor Edward Nunes, ColumbiaMedical School at the American Society of Addiction Medicine 50th Annual Meetingin Orlando, and generated significant interest.Court proceedings initiated in the USAfter the first quarter, our partner Braeburn filed an action in federaldistrict court for the District of Columbia, seeking to overturn the marketexclusivity extending to 30 November 2020 granted by the US Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) to Sublocade™, and seeking immediate approval of Brixadi™.A court decision is expected during the third quarter of 2019.Continued investment in the product pipelineThe last patients in the 52-week Phase 3 long-term safety extension study ofCAM2038 in patients with chronic pain completed their treatment during the firstquarter of 2019. After closing of the database and compiling of results and thestudy report, we will meet with European regulatory authorities to discuss theregulatory submission for CAM2038 for the treatment of chronic pain. We plan tosubmit in the EU during the first half of 2020.Another important milestone for us is the start of the Phase 3 program for oursubcutaneous octreotide, CAM2029, being developed for the treatment ofacromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors (NET). CAM2029 has been designed for easyself-administration and optimization of treatment effects for these chronicdiseases. During the first quarter, we initiated manufacturing and finalized thepivotal Phase 3 study protocol after alignment of study details with the FDA.Clinical trial applications are submitted in the US and a number of nationalregulatory authorities in Europe. The goal is to start treatment in the Phase 3study of CAM2029 at the beginning of the third quarter of 2019.We also continued to work on the development of a Phase 2 study of CAM2043(treprostinil), for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) andsystemic sclerosis and aim to initiate Phase 2 clinical trials in patientstowards the end of the year. Additionally, activities continued in otherinternal projects as well as in our partnerships, including with Braeburn,Rhythm and Solasia.To secure financing of prioritized development projects and for the launch ofBuvidal® in Europe and Australia, we completed a rights issue of SEK 403 millionbefore issue costs towards the end of the quarter.Focus on launches and growthOur key objective for 2019 is to give patients in Europe and Australia rapidaccess to treatment with Buvidal®. Based on the high unmet medical need inopioid dependence and the positive feedback on treatment with Buvidal® from bothpatients and healthcare providers, we expect to see significant sales and growthover the year. This ambition is supported by a strong commercial organizationwith fully operational regional teams in Germany, the UK, the Nordics andAustralia, and with local presence in France, Spain and Italy. With thesignificant opportunity presented by Buvidal® in opioid dependence, alongsideexpected development milestones in our pipeline of innovative products and ourpartnerships, I believe the 2019 outlook for Camurus is optimistic and willenable us to deliver strong growth and value for patients and shareholders.Fredrik TibergPresident and CEOFor more information:Fredrik Tiberg, CEO and Head of ResearchTel. +46 (0)46 286 46 92fredrik.tiberg@camurus.comFredrik Joabsson, Chief Business Development OfficerTel. +46 (0)70 776 17 37ir@camurus.comThis information is information that Camurus AB is obliged to make publicpursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Swedish Securities MarketsAct.

The improvements are primarily due to a very strong development in the Swedish online business under Stockholms Auktionsverk and a small increase in Denmark.Together with cost reductions of 4 percent (like for like business) this results in the best Q1 performance from operations since the group was listed in 2016. EBITDA in 2019 is DKK 1,957k compared to DKK -3,555k (excluding the gain from sale of the Fine Art business in 2018 and accrual release) in 2018 and approximately DKK 0k in 2017 (excluding the fees from sale of partnership agreements and adjusting for IFRS 16).Despite a very cyclical business with Q1 as the weakest period of the year cash flow from operations for Q1 has improved by DKK 28m compared to 2018.We have seen an improved market demand for our products and a positive response on our financing situation, which together has made us see a change in the development to the better. Furthermore, the start of Q2 has continued this development and we foresee the positive momentum continuing during the year.To support and strengthen the positive development we will continue the intensified sales- and marketing initiatives and further increase the focus on operations of the business.Commercial initiativesA number of commercial initiatives are showing positive effect on the Q1 results. Among them an increased focus on sales management, business control and execution both internally in the headquarters and in relation to the individual auction houses.Furthermore, all our auction houses has gone through a comprehensive optimization process in terms of logistics and handling of the auction supply chain, which has released resources for intensified sales activities.In terms of marketing activities, we have focused on creating local activities including an increase in our outreach via focused social media, which has shown a positive effect and strengthened our presence in the local and regional communities.Furthermore, in order to keep a high visibility in the market, we continuously and persistently communicate our standard free pickup-service and personal booking of experts for private home visits. Furthermore, we are targeting professional sellers to consign larger lot stocks, like previous season's product inventories or surplus items that are suitable for selling at auctions. The benefits of selling at auction are many for our professional sellers - some of the major benefits are massive exposure and a higher stock turnover rate as well as storage capacity, logistics and resales all being handled by the auction house. In order to give both private and professional sellers more comfort in relation to the price they will achieve in an auction, we are working at a more flexible and individual setup for setting minimum prices and starting bid for the auction.The reacquisition of the Fine Art business in March 2019 concluded a turbulent year for this part of the group. We are now focusing on developing this business with a strong base in the facilities at Nybrogatan in Stockholm.Refinancing of BondsThe refinancing of the bonds has been agreed with the bondholders, and all legal work related to finalizing the changes is almost completed.The impact of the refinancing will be included in Q2.The clarification of the financing situation and the positive development in Auction turnover and profit achieved confirm our confidence in a successful development in the coming years for  Lauritz.com.

Theconfirmatory Phase 3 study with the drug candidate BAN2401, a potential diseasemodifying treatment for early Alzheimer’s disease, has been initiated. In theParkinson program, the Phase 1 study with the drug candidate ABBV-0805 hasstarted. The product candidate SC0806 for complete spinal cord injury hasadvanced into the second part of the on-going Phase 1/2-study. All in all, thismeans that we have had a very successful first quarter. It is also gratifying tonote that we have had another period with a positive net financial result.In March, Eisai announced that they initiated the global, confirmatory Phase 3study with BAN2401 (Clarity AD/Study 301) in patients with early Alzheimer’sdisease based on discussions with regulatory authorities. The study is expectedto include 1,566 patients who will either be treated with BAN2401 or receiveplacebo. In the treatment group, BAN2401 will be administered at a dosage of 10mg/kg twice a month. The primary endpoint is change from baseline in thecognition and function scale CDR-SB at 18 months of treatment. Changes in theclinical scales ADCOMS and ADAS-Cog will be key secondary endpoints togetherwith brain amyloid levels as measured by amyloid PET. According to Eisai, thefinal readout of the primary endpoint is targeted as early as for 2022.The confirmatory Phase 3 study, which supports the regulatory filing, isdesigned based on the positive results from the Phase 2b study with BAN2401 in856 patients with early Alzheimer´s disease. The Phase 2b-study robustlydemonstrated slowing of clinical decline, effects on biomarkers with goodtolerability after 18 months treatment. BAN2401 is a unique antibody that bindsselectively to the toxic soluble aggregated forms of amyloid beta in the brain,so called protofibrils, which are believed to be the harmful forms of amyloidbeta. The Phase 2b-study with BAN2401 is the first study in late clinical phaseto have demonstrated a potential disease modifying effect on clinical functionas well as clearance of amyloid beta in the brain, and effects onneurodegenerative biomarkers. The results from the Phase 2b study strengthenBioArctic's belief that BAN2401's unique binding profile is important, which issupported also by the stopped trials with other companies’ antibodies. It isvery encouraging to note Eisai's strong commitment to the continued clinicaldevelopment of BAN2401 in early Alzheimer's disease.In late 2018, BioArctic out-licensed its portfolio of antibodies to alpha-synuclein for disease modifying treatment of Parkinson’s disease and otherpotential indications to the company’s strategic partner AbbVie. The licensingtriggered a milestone payment to BioArctic of MUSD 50. BioArctic has developedthe groundwork for the application to start clinical trials with ABBV-0805 inthe U.S., a so-called IND application. In February 2019, the U.S, Food and DrugAdministration, FDA, approved the application. Already in March, AbbVie startedthe Phase 1 study and they are responsible for financing and running theclinical program with ABBV-0805.BioArctic's Alzheimer and Parkinson projects in research stages, as well ascollaborative projects on biomarkers and technologies, have continued to developwell. In collaboration with Uppsala University, BioArctic develops technologiesthat facilitate the passage of antibodies across the blood-brain barrier withthe aim to improve immunotherapy for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Theblood-brain barrier controls the exchange of substances between the blood andthe brain and protects the brain from toxins and other pathogens, but it mayalso limit the delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain. Recently, BioArcticand Uppsala University received a non-dilutive grant of MSEK 10 from Sweden’sInnovation Agency, Vinnova, for a collaboration project aimed at developingmulti-specific antibodies with a transporter to facilitate passage across theblood brain barrier. This innovative technology could potentially be used totreat various diseases of the brain. The research work is at a very early stagebut addresses an important challenge that can have revolutionary significance inthe future.BioArctic conducts a clinical study in patients with complete spinal cord injurywith the product candidate SC0806 currently in Phase 1/2. The clinicaldevelopment has, to a large extent, been financed by grants from EU’s Horizon2020. At the beginning of the year, a safety evaluation of all patients in thefirst panel was performed, supporting the start of the next panel. In February,the first patient in the second panel was treated with SC0806 and the secondpart of the Phase 1/2 study has thus started. An interim analysis of the firstpanel concerning efficacy and safety is planned for the first half of 2020, atthe latest.The forward momentum of the projects in all therapy areas during the past yearand the first quarter of this year has created a very good basis for a continuedprogress for BioArctic. I look forward to developing our innovative projectsfurther within our three disease areas, which all have high unmet medical needs.I am proud to lead this innovative company and our work to improve the qualityof life for patients with central nervous system disorders.Gunilla OsswaldCEO, BioArctic ABContactsFor further information, please contact:Gunilla Osswald, CEO, gunilla.osswald@bioarctic.se, telephone + 46 (0)8 695 6930Jan Mattsson, CFO, jan.mattsson@bioarctic.se, telephone + 46 (0)703 52 27 72PresentationBioArctic invites to an audiocast with teleconference (in English) forinvestors, analysts and media today, May 9, at 09:30 – 10:30 a.m. CET.

Bactiguard Holding AB,2019-05-09 08:00:00,"A stable beginning of the yearThe beginning of 2019 was stable. Revenues increased somewhat, while the EBITDAresult and margin greatly improved. 2018 was an exciting and eventful year forBactiguard when we reached several important milestones, so we have highexpectations for 2019.First quarter (January-March 2019)  · Revenues amounted to SEK 35.1 (33.0) million, an increase mainly driven byhigher license revenues.  · BIP sales amounted to SEK 3.1 (7.3) million. No deliveries were made toChina and India this quarter, while first quarter of 2018 contained majordeliveries to both these markets. Sales in other regions grew in the quarter.  · EBITDA amounted to SEK 7.2 (1.8) million, with an EBITDA margin of 20% (6%).  · Operating profit amounted to SEK -3.4 (-6.9) million.  · Net profit/loss amounted to SEK -3.4 (-8.0) million, or SEK -0.10 (-0.24)per share.  · Operating cash flow for the quarter amounted to SEK -9.1 (-13.7) million, orSEK -0.27 (-0.41) per share. A payment of SEK 11.5 million related to a one-offcompensation for early termination of the agreement with the former distributorin China in 2018 affected cash flow, but not earnings and profit, in thequarter.Key events during the first quarter  · Bactiguard focuses operations in MEA and transfers accounts receivable inIraqKey events after the end of the first quarter  · The Nomination Committee proposes Professor Anna Martling and Thomas vonKoch as new Board members  · New Senior Vice President OperationsComments by the CEOThe beginning of 2019 was stable. Revenues increased somewhat, while the EBITDAresult and margin greatly improved. 2018 was an exciting and eventful year forBactiguard when we reached several important milestones, so we have highexpectations for 2019.BIP sales were lower this quarter but bear in mind that we made major deliveriesto China and India in early 2018. This year, no deliveries have yet been made tothese markets. In China, this is due to large deliveries just before the end oflast year and in India our distributor is waiting for a renewed import license.Sales and marketing activities in the Chinese market are proceeding at a highintensity. Well Lead has strengthened its team of Bactiguard salesrepresentatives and identified regional distributors and retailers to improvemarket coverage. In connection with the annual urology congress in Europe (EAU),we had the opportunity to establish closer contact with many Chinese doctors andkey opinion leaders. We will continue to develop that network in close dialoguewith Well Lead and their Advisory Board.The ties between Sweden and India are strong and this year the 10th anniversaryof the national cooperation in health and medical care is celebrated. ""SwedenIndia Year of Health 2019"" began with a delegation trip led by the Minister ofHealth and Social Affairs Lena Hallengren. A tangible outcome of the trip is acollaboration between Bactiguard and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences(AIIMS) in Jodphur, where all products in Bactiguard's portfolio will beevaluated. The purpose is to broaden the use of infection preventive products inregular care, both in Jodphur and at other AIIMS hospitals. In parallel, aseries of training activities are organized in infection prevention. The largeclinical trial that has been ongoing for a couple of years is completed. Whenthe study is published, it will become a valuable sales tool that can contributeto wider use.In Europe, we established partnership with Mediplast for the Nordic and Beneluxcountries in 2018. Their sales representatives are now active in these markets.At the same time, we have recently recruited a sales manager for Germany tostrengthen our own organization and assist our partner Asid Bonz in the salesand marketing activities. Several of the smaller European markets are developingwell and we see steadily increasing sales to end customers. One example is thehomecare segment in Poland, where we reached all-time-high in March.The Middle East is well on the way back and several of the major markets areincreasing their sales to the end customer. Last year was an interim year andthis year we expect growth across the region.License revenues from Becton, Dickinson & Company (BD) were higher than the yearbefore. Volumes tend to vary between quarters without following any clearseasonal pattern. The process of registering our entire portfolio of products inChina, together with Well Lead, is making good progress and we received newlicense revenues of just over SEK 1 million in the quarter.The EBITDA result and margin were significantly higher than last year. Thisdevelopment was primarily driven by higher license revenues, with high margins,but also by new accounting principles for leasing (IFRS 16). If we disregard theaccounting-related effects, the EBITDA margin was 13%, which is more than adoubling from the previous year.Increasing sales of our own product portfolio in China, India, Europe and theMiddle East is high on our agenda. We do this in cooperation between ourdistributors and our own regional sales organization. The focus is on broadeningthe use of our products in the markets where we are already present andestablishing presence in a few additional large European markets.Developing new license deals is just as prioritized. Over the past two years, wehave signed two new license agreements - one for advanced vascular injectioncatheters and one for our entire product portfolio in China. With the new CEmark for orthopedic trauma implants that was announced in December 2018 and aclinical trial in patients soon to be completed, I feel quite certain that thenext license deal will cover this application area. At the same time, there aremany more interesting areas linked to our own product portfolio which preventinfections in the urinary tract, airways and blood stream. An application areathat we have yet to explore, where infections are common, and our technologywould add value, is wound care. There is no shortage of ideas and initiatives,but we must focus our efforts.In conclusion, I would like to mention the management changes we are nowimplementing. In her role as CFO, Cecilia Edström is an important partner to mein the management team, with responsibility for strategy and businessdevelopment. Jonas Östregård has been given increased responsibility as SeniorVice President Sales & Marketing and recently we recruited Daniel Lund, withbroad experience in supply chain management, to the role of Senior VicePresident Operations. At the same time, we have initiated the recruitment of aChief Medical and Technology Officer who will contribute to the development ofthe medical strategy and competence of the company. We make these changes tobuild for the future and take Bactiguard to the next level. 2019 has all theprerequisites to become a new exciting and eventful year for the company.Christian KinchCEOThe interim report for Bactiguard Holding AB (publ) for the period January-March2019 is available as a PDF at www.bactiguard.comThis information is information that Bactiguard Holding AB (publ) is obliged tomake public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

The rate of growth was constrained by ESL having two fewerMasters properties than in the first quarter last year, but the two Mastersproperties that were activated generated revenues substantially higher than inthe previous year, and we also delivered four more Challenger properties thisyear. Our properties featured Fortnite for the first time, generating stronginterest from fans. Dreamhack’s newly launched e-FIFA leagues in Denmark andSweden delivered strong incremental revenues.Gaming delivers good mobile growthInnoGames achieved good growth in mobile sales, with more than half of Forge ofEmpires revenue coming from mobile for the first time. InnoGames also launchedGod Kings, a new mobile game that is showing strong initial results. The startof the turnaround in Kongregate drove an improvement in the revenue performancein Gaming, compared to the sharp decline we saw in the previous quarter, and theAdjusted EBITDA margin also improved sequentially, both of these reflectingKongregate’s focus on a smaller number of successful games.Jørgen Madsen LindemannPresident & Chief Executive Officer“Our world-leading esports business returned to growth in the quarter, with bothof ESL’s Masters properties and Dreamhack’s e-FIFA leagues delivering recordnumbers of viewers and attracting a growing range of high-quality sponsors andmedia partners. InnoGames had a solid quarter and we also saw the performance ofKongregate start to turn around. With Nova now sold, we can focus fully onexpanding our portfolio of successful games companies.”Outlook & FY 2019 ambitionNo change to previously announced ambitionThe Group’s ambition for the full-year 2019 remains as stated at the CapitalMarkets Day in March, being to deliver organic sales growth of mid-teens percentand an Adjusted EBITDA margin in mid-single digits, after Group central costsand excluding the impact of IFRS 16. The performance will be second-halfweighted, driven by better monetisation of Owned & Operated esports properties,the continuing strong performance of InnoGames, and the operational turnaroundsbeing implemented in Kongregate and Zoomin.Shareholders information2019 Annual General MeetingThe 2019 Annual General Meeting will be held on 21 May 2019 in Stockholm.The notices to the Meeting and related materials can be found at www.mtg.com.Financial calendarAnnual General Meeting 2019         21 May 2019Q2 results announcement             22 July 2019Q3 results announcement             29 October 2019Questions?press@mtg.cominvestors@mtg.com (or David Boyd, Head of Investor Relations +46 73 699 29 99)Download high-resolution photos:Flickr (https://www.flickr.com/photos/moderntimesgroup/)Follow us: mtg.com (http://www.mtg.com/) /Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/MTGAB) / Twitter (https://twitter.com/MTGAB)/ LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/modern-times-group-mtg) /Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/moderntimesgroup/) /YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK31pEkE8KUDJuKd9bHckBA)Conference callThe company will host a conference call today at 9:00 Stockholm local time.

We generated a top line growth of 16 percent to MSEK 2,458 and ouradjusted EBIT increased by MSEK 28 to MSEK 110 compared to the same quarter lastyear, of which MSEK 9 was attributed to reduced depreciation.The demand for our products continued to flourish in the first quarter. Theexceptionally strong top line growth was partly due to a large contingency orderwithin Ready-to-eat and the consolidation of Rokkedahl Food ApS which wasacquired in the third quarter last year. The underlying growth was, however,well above the 7 percent average we have demonstrated over the last five years.Poultry products are becoming increasingly attractive to consumers due to taste,health attributes, environmental profile and not least a very favourable pricingcompared to the alternatives. During the last years we have gained market sharein our home markets through the introduction of new innovative products,improved communication of our sustainability work and a strengthened position ofour main brands. I am convinced that these drivers will continue to work in ourfavour and enable us to sustain significant growth over the longer term.The strongest growth was generated in the Ready-to-cook Chilled category (15percent) and, as mentioned, in the Ready-to-eat category (36 percent). Wecontinue to observe a decline in the less profitable Ready-to-cook Frozencategory (‑1 percent) and export decreased to below 8 percent of net sales inthe first quarter.As previously known, our margins have been under pressure during the last coupleof years due to several of our most significant risk factors providing headwindsimultaneously. Coming out of this challenging period, I am proud to report thatthe overall margin impact was limited to about 1.5 percentage points. Thisdemonstrates our ability to generate stable results through application of askilled organisation, a robust structural setup, ability to pass through rawmaterial price changes and geographic diversification. Now that we have entereda more favourable environment, I am looking forward to demonstrating theearnings power inherent in our business model.Scandi Standard is uniquely positioned among our competitors in our homemarkets. We are geographically well diversified and increasingly reaping thebenefits of best practice across the individual markets.As previously communicated, we have identified several capital projects inIreland post acquisition aimed at increased efficiency, animal welfare, foodsafety differentiation and debottlenecking. We have decided to phase in a numberof these investments this year. For the group, we expect to invest around MSEK380 in 2019. During the first half of 2019 we will pay the first tranche for theearn out linked to the Manor Farm acquisition in the amount of MSEK 125.By the end of the first quarter 2019, our net interest-bearing debt was MSEK2,411 compared to MSEK 2,391 at the end of the first quarter 2018, an increasewith MSEK 20. We remain committed to reinvest a large proportion of our cashflowin the business to fuel profitable growth. Over time, increased earnings willenable us to maintain a competitive direct yield to our shareholders whilstallocating sufficient funds to take advantage of our strong growthopportunities. The Board has proposed a dividend of SEK 2.00 per share for 2019corresponding to MSEK 131.We are carefully following the structural changes in our sector and believe thatwe are ideally positioned to take part of the consolidation of the Europeanmarket. We believe the acquisition of Manor Farm is a good illustration of howwe can create value and stability for our shareholders. The acquisition hascontributed to further geographic diversification and we are happy with ourcross-country teams’ ability to deliver benefits through exchanging bestpractice within the group.I am pleased with the way the Scandi Standard is currently positioned with arobust business model of sustainably produced, healthy products. Based on thecurrent market outlook, I see good opportunities for incrementally improvingreturns to the shareholders in the coming periods.Leif Bergvall HansenManaging Director and CEOConference callA conference call for investors, analysts and media will be held on 9 May 2019at 8.30 AM CET.Dial-in numbers:UK: 020 3936 2999Sweden: 010 884 80 16US: 1 845 709 8568Other countries: +44 20 3936 2999Slides used in the conference call can be downloaded at www.scandistandard.comunder Investor Relations.

Arion banki hf.,2019-05-08 19:39:55,"Arion Bank hf.Interim report (Q1 and Q3)Arion Bank’s Q1 2019 financial resultsPositive development in core operations but irregular items affect net earningsArion Bank reported net earnings of ISK 1.0 billion for the first quarter of 2019, compared with ISK 1.9 billion for the same period of 2018. Return on equity was 2.1% for the first quarter of 2019, compared with 3.6% for the same period in 2018. Return on equity excluding the subsidiary Valitor, which is classified as held for sale, was 6.2% for the first quarter of 2019, compared with 4.8% for the same period in 2018.Total assets amounted to ISK 1,223 billion at the end of March 2019, compared with ISK 1,164 billion at the end of 2018. Total equity amounted to ISK 193 billion, compared with ISK 201 billion at the end of 2018. During the first quarter of 2019 Arion Bank paid a dividend of ISK 10 billion, or ISK 5.00 per share.  The Bank’s capital ratio at the end of March 2019 was 22.3%, compared with 22.0% at the end of 2018. The CET1 ratio was 21.3% at the end of March 2019, compared with 21.2% at the end of 2018.Stefán Pétursson, acting CEO of Arion Bank“Irregular items mean that the financial results for the first quarter were disappointing. Regular operations are, however, improving, and key sources of income such as interest and commission income and insurance income are higher than in the first quarter of 2018. The net interest margin remains stable despite lower inflation and the effects of the Bank's measures to lower its funding costs have yet to materialize in full. The bankruptcy of WOW Air and the judgement by Reykjavík District Court against Valitor are the main irregular items negatively affecting the Bank’s financial results, whereas the Bank’s sale of its holding in Farice had a positive effect. The economic slowdown has affected revenue growth and increased general impairments, which are determined on the basis of the economic outlook at any given time. Operating expenses are stable and we are continuing to target improved cost efficiency. One of the ways we seek to achieve this is by placing a greater focus on digital solutions. In the last few years the Bank has launched a range of digital solutions which have proven highly popular among our customers, making it easier for them to take care of their finances and easier for us to provide good service. In the first quarter a new version of the Arion App was launched which can be used by anyone wanting to do business with us. Today we are bringing Apple Pay to our customers. From today our customers can add their VISA cards to Apple Pay and use their iPhone, Apple Watch or Mac to make fast and secure purchases in stores, on websites, in apps and numerous other locations in Iceland and abroad. Doing your banking and paying for goods and services has never been so easy.The Bank remains financially robust and several important steps were taken during the period to optimize the capital structure. The AGM approved a proposal to reduce the Bank's share capital by cancelling the Bank's own shares, 9.3% of share capital, and to pay dividends amounting to ISK 5 a share, or approximately net ISK 9 billion. These measures have already been taken and represent important steps towards the Bank’s achieving its financial targets over the next 3-5 years.   Arion Bank recently signed a statement that it would endorse and adopt six new UNEP FI Principles for Responsible Banking. The United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) is a partnership between United Nations Environment and more than 240 financial institutions across the world. We will utilize this platform and the principles on our journey towards responsible banking and sustainability. The aim of the principles is to align the banking sector with international commitments including the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement.   As we have communicated earlier, Arion Bank’s subsidiary Valitor, an international payment solutions company with operations in Iceland, the United Kingdom and Denmark, is currently in the process of being sold and the goal is to sell part or the whole of the company. The necessary preparatory work is close to completion and marketing to potential investors will start in the coming weeks. We expect this process to be concluded this year. The recent judgment by Reykjavík District Court, which ordered the company to pay ISK 1.2 billion in damages, is not expected to affect the sales process. In April, Valitor entered into a new 2-year business agreement with Stripe, one of the leading Fintech companies in the world.”    Webcast for market participantsArion Bank will be hosting a meeting / webcast on Thursday 9 May at 8:30 GMT (10:30 CET) where acting CEO Stefán Pétursson, Deputy CFO Eggert Teitsson and Head of Investor Relations Sture Stölen will present the results and answer questions from participants.

Instalco Instressenter AB,2019-05-08 12:00:00,"Continued good profitability, growth and cash flowJanuary – March 2019  · Net sales increased by 24.4 percent to SEK 1,218 (979) million. Organicgrowth was 5.8 (3.0) percent.  · Adjusted EBITA increased to SEK 92 (73) million which corresponds to anadjusted EBITA margin of 7.6 (7.4) percent.  · Operating cash flow for the quarter was SEK 156 (90) million.  · Three acquisitions were made during the quarter, which, on an annual basiscontribute an estimated total annual sales of SEK 227 million.  · Earnings per share for the quarter amounted to SEK 1.37 (0.42).Comments from CEO Per Sjöstrand:Instalco started 2019 with good growth and rising profitability. Sales for thequarter amounted to SEK 1,218 (979) million. Growth for the quarter was 24.4percent, of which 5.8 percent was organic growth. Adjusted EBITA for the firstquarter was SEK 92 (73) million, which corresponds to an adjusted EBITA marginof 7.6 (7.4) percent. Order backlog remained stable and at the end of thequarter, it amounted to SEK 4,391 (3,736) million, which corresponds to anincrease of 17.5 percent.Acquisition of quality companiesDuring the first quarter, we made three acquisitions of high quality companiesin Sweden. EKTK i Sala AB specializes in electricity and distribution networksand the acquisition strengthens our position and offering to industrialcompanies. In the area of heating & plumbing, we acquired Aquadus VVS AB inEskilstuna. It is situated in Mälardalen, which is a strategically importantarea to Instalco. We have also grown in Stockholm via our acquisition of AircanoAB, which is a ventilation company.During the quarter, we also started up a new company of our own, KWA-rör AB inYstad. The strategy of starting up own companies has arisen as a supplement toour main acquisition strategy. We will apply Instalco’s “start-up model”selectively, when the right conditions and the right local contractors arepresent.At the start of the year, we redeployed the CEOs at four of our subsidiaries.The former CEOs at Rörläggaren and Andersen og Aksnes are now working full timeas the head of business areas at Instalco. El-Expressen has had a generationchange and the former CEO at Rodens Värme & Sanitet is now in charge of growingthe company in new installation branches. All of the newly appointed CEOs wereinternally recruited from within the subsidiary and through Instalco Academy.Collaboration and synergiesInstalco focuses on the “middle” segment, by which we mean smaller and medium-sized projects. Our companies are highly specialised in their areas ofoperations, which is a key component of the Instalco model. It also facilitatescollaboration between different disciplines, which, in turn, leads to higherefficiency and margins.One example is the multi-disciplinary project in Bålsta, where  DALAB,Sprinklerbolaget and Automationsbolaget are collaborating on installation workfor Skanska, which is building a new ICA Maxi grocery store. The projectinvolves installation of heating & plumbing, ventilation and sprinkler systems,along with control and monitoring systems.Another example is collaboration between VVS ­Installatör and DALAB oninstallations of heating & plumbing, electricity and ventilation systems forFalu Municipality, which is building the Södra School in Falun.At the beginning of the year, it was also announced that Instalco had beenawarded new contracts associated with construction of the ESS research facilityin Lund. ­Rörläggaren and Bi-Vent have been contracted by Skanska forventilation and pipe installation work for the campus area of the ESS researchinstitute. Once it is operational in 2023, European Spallation Source (ESS) inLund will conduct research related to materials, energy, health, the environmentand more.As the Instalco Group grows, we have also noticed an increase in collaborationbetween our subsidiaries. Cross-selling increases and new customer contacts aremade. Furthermore, companies get opportunities to collaborate on projects thatthey would not have had access to on their own.During 2019 we will continue our work with an updated group sustainabilityprogramme.Continued stable marketLooking forward, our assessment is that the market will remain stable, with acontinued high demand for installation services. However, with the overallslowdown in the economy, it is now taking a bit more time than usual for some ofour projects to get going.I am nevertheless enthusiastic about the year ahead for Instalco, during whichwe will celebrate our 5th anniversary.Report presentationInstalco’s CEO Per Sjöstrand and CFO Lotta Sjögren will present the report in aconference call/audiocast today 8 May at 14.00 CET.

The information was submitted for publication at 8:05a.m. CET on May 8, 2019.Non-IFRS Measures:This press release includes non-IFRS measures not defined under IFRS,specifically EBITDA and Adjusted operating cash flow. Non-IFRS measures have nostandardized meaning prescribed under IFRS and therefore such measures may notbe comparable with those used by other companies.  EBITDA is a useful metric toquantify the Company’s ability to generate cash before extraordinary and non-cash accounting transactions recognized in the financial statements. Inaddition, EBITDA is useful to analyze and compare profitability betweencompanies and industries because it eliminates the effects of financing andaccounting policy decisions. The most comparable IFRS measure to EBITDA is netincome (loss). In addition, adjusted operating cash flow is used by investors tocompare cash flows from operating activities without the effects of certainvolatile items that can positively or negatively affect changes in workingcapital and are viewed as not directly related to a company’s operatingperformance. The most comparable IFRS measure to adjusted operating cash flow iscash flow used in operations. Refer to Etrion’s MD&A for the three months endedMarch 31, 2019, for a reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted operating cash flowreported during the period.Forward-Looking Information:This press release contains certain “forward-looking information”.

Despite this we have hadprice reductions during the autumn and winter. The main reason for this isproduction increases in Europe, mainly due to heavy log supply from sprucebeetle damaged forests in central Europe. We also see reduced European export toChina and an uncertain situation with Brexit. All this together has given asituation where buyers are more cautious when buying. Prices have been reducedmainly on spruce and lower qualities, whereas redwood prices are more stable.The price decreases will impact sawmill margins during the second quarter forthis year. Swedish mills will benefit from the weak SEK. Declining raw materialprices are likely to gradually and partially compensate for the reduced prices.The market for further processed products remains good and margins are stable.Bergs Timber’s developmentOn a proforma basis, i.e.including the businesses acquired in the Baltics andthe UK, our profitability for the first quarter remains unchanged from lastyear. For the mid-term we believe that prices will stabilize and that rawmaterial price reductions gradually will compensate for the reduced prices.We are having good results from our productivity programs. This is related toall areas of the company and due to both small steps as well as investments. Thepreviously announced closing of the saw mills in Broakulla in Sweden and Savi inEstonia proceeds according to plan. The consolidation is expected to give ayearly EBIT improvement of SEK 20-25 million.There is still a risk that last year’s spruce beetle attack in southern Swedenwill develop to a greater extent, which in turn might lead to a change in ourproduction plans for the autumn and winter.Our operations for further processing show a healthy growth and we work hard toexpand this part of our business. We are investing in a new house buildingfactory in Byko – Lat in Latvia. This will at the same time enable us toincrease the production of doors and windows. Plans also proceed to increaseproduction at our Bitus operation in Sweden. Further on we are investing in ourport Creeksea in UK and we are also establishing a new distributionorganization.Potential acquisitionWe have today announced our intention to enter the Swedish pellet market byacquiring Fågelfors Hylveri. Fågelfors has a brand new pellet factory withannual capacity of about 90,000 tons. Fågelfors suits our strategy to increasefurther processing of our products and by-products while at the same time beinglocated close to our Swedish saw mills.Long term developmentThe global awareness of the need of a more sustainable consumption is increasingat an ever faster rate. This is gradually giving more demand for renewable rawmaterials where wood is a very good alternative. The development for new woodproducts and building systems also make the material competitive in commercialbuildings.Productivity improvements in our saw mills and a gradually higher degree offurther processing is strengthening Bergs Timber and will position us to be ableto handle new opportunities as well as changes in the market.Peter NilssonChief Executive OfficerFurther information regarding the interim report can be provided by the CEO,Peter Nilsson, on telephone number +46 70 315 09 27 or CFO, Anders Marklund, on+46 70 284 47 96.The information in this interim report is such that Bergs Timber AB (publ) isobliged to disclose pursuant to the EU's Market Abuse Regulation and the SwedishSecurities Market Act.

International Petroleum Corporation,2019-05-08 07:30:00,"International Petroleum CorporationInterim report (Q1 and Q3)International Petroleum Corporation First Quarter 2019 Financial ResultsInternational Petroleum Corporation (IPC or the Corporation) (TSX, Nasdaq Stockholm: IPCO) today released its financial and operating results and related management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) for the three months ended March 31, 2019.Financial and Operational HighlightsAverage net production of 44,400 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day (boepd) for Q1 2019.The impact of extreme weather on Canada gas production (9% below mid-point guidance) was more than offset by higher realized gas prices (31% above forecast). All other producing assets in line with mid-point guidance.Operating costs per boe of USD 13.2 for Q1 2019, in line with guidance.Canada Suffield area oil drilling program results in line with pre-drill expectations.Malaysia exploration and three well infill drilling program on track to commence in Q2 2019.France Vert La Gravelle redevelopment project on track to commence in Q2 2019.Completed acquisition of lands adjoining the Blackrod project in Canada, with best estimate contingent resources (unrisked) of 243 million boe (MMboe).Capital expenditure budget increased from USD 166 million to USD 188 million, including to fund the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) development project at the Suffield N2N oil field and further conventional oil drilling in the acquired BlackPearl assets in Alberta.Strong first quarter operating cash flow generation of USD 83 million at the upper end of guidance following the inclusion of the acquired BlackPearl assets and stronger than forecast realized crude oil and natural gas prices.Net debt reduced from USD 309 million as at March 31, 2018 to USD 257 million as at March 31, 2019, including net debt from the acquisition of BlackPearl.  Three months endedMarch 31  USD Thousands 2019 2018  Revenue 147,420 115,162  Gross profit 46,885 37,573  Net result 33,142 26,313  Operating cash flow 83,056 76,060  EBITDA 81,675 65,291  Net Debt 256,962 309,184  Mike Nicholson, IPC's Chief Executive Officer, commented,""Our focus remains unchanged: seeking to deliver operational excellence, demonstrating financial resilience, maximizing the value of our resource base and targeting growth organically and through acquisition. With a strong set of first quarter results including for the first time the results of our BlackPearl acquisition completed in December 2018, as well as announcing an expanded organic growth program and a very low cost acquisition of material contingent resources, we continue to make excellent progress on all fronts in delivering on that strategy.During Q1 2019, our assets delivered average daily net production of 44,400 boepd. All assets performed in line with our mid-point guidance with the exception of Suffield gas production in Canada. Abnormally cold temperatures experienced during the first quarter resulted in lower gas production. However, the lower production was more than offset by a higher realized gas price. Production guidance for the full year is retained at 46,000 to 50,000 boepd. Our operating costs per boe for Q1 2019 was USD 13.2, in line with guidance.IPC has continued to deliver a robust financial performance during Q1 2019 generating a record high quarterly operating cash flow of USD 83 million, at the upper end of guidance. This allowed IPC to fund its expenditure program and reduce net debt from USD 277 million at the end of 2018 to USD 257 million by the end of the first quarter.In Malaysia, following positive results from the 2016 and 2018 infill drilling programs and continued good reservoir performance, we approved a third phase of infill drilling on the Bertam field for execution in 2019. In addition, we plan to drill the Keruing prospect as part of the same 2019 campaign. We remain on track for the drilling program to commence in Q2 2019.In Canada, we plan to drill seventeen development oil wells in the Suffield area in 2019, excluding wells related to the Suffield N2N EOR project. The drilling campaign commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018 and production has been in line with pre-drill expectations. Onion Lake facility optimization and ramp up is ongoing although the abnormally cold weather during the first quarter has led to a slightly slower ramp up than planned as we entered the second quarter. On the gas side, the gas optimization program continues with the objective of minimizing natural declines through 2019.In France, our team is focused on the execution of the Vert La Gravelle redevelopment project using horizontal drilling techniques. The rig has been contracted and is expected to be on location this month to commence the drilling of three wells as scheduled.In addition, we have successfully completed our reviews of the Suffield N2N EOR development project in Canada and plan to proceed with the drilling of eight development oil wells and the injection of Alkaline Surfactant Polymer (ASP) to improve sweep efficiency and recovery factors. We have also identified two potential new conventional oil plays on properties acquired as part of the BlackPearl transaction and we plan to drill five wells that in the success case, could identify up to 130 conventional oil drilling locations. As a result, we are increasing our capital budget by USD 22 million, from USD 166 million which was at the upper end of our guidance to USD 188 million. Following these changes to our capital expenditure budget, and given our very strong cash flow generation year to date, we still expect to fully fund the 2019 capital program from our operating cash flow.We are also pleased to report that, in less than five months since completion of the BlackPearl Acquisition, we have been able to acquire a significant land and contingent resource position adjacent to the Blackrod property. We believe that the acquired land position holds among the best quality reservoir and pay thickness that we currently hold in the area, significantly expanding our core area at Blackrod. These acquired lands are 100% working interest to IPC and include best estimate contingent resources (unrisked) of 243 MMboe, increasing IPC’s total contingent resources at the Blackrod project to 987 MMboe and IPC’s total contingent resources base to almost 1,100 MMboe.”International Petroleum Corp. (IPC) is an international oil and gas exploration and production company with a high quality portfolio of assets located in Canada, Malaysia and France, providing a solid foundation for organic and inorganic growth.

The Corporation's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) have been filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) and are also available on the Corporation's website (www.international-petroleum.com).Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains statements and information which constitute ""forward-looking statements"" or ""forward-looking information"" (within the meaning of applicable securities legislation). Such statements and information (together, ""forward-looking statements"") relate to future events, including the Corporation's future performance, business prospects or opportunities. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, unless otherwise indicated. IPC does not intend, and does not assume any obligation, to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable laws.All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, forecasts, guidance, budgets, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always, using words or phrases such as ""seek"", ""anticipate"", ""plan"", ""continue"", ""estimate"", ""expect"", ""may"", ""will"", ""project"", “forecast”, ""predict"", ""potential"", ""targeting"", ""intend"", ""could"", ""might"", ""should"", ""believe"", ""budget"" and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be ""forward-looking statements"". Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: IPC’s intention and ability to continue to implement strategies to build long-term shareholder value IPC’s intention to review future potential growth opportunities the ability of IPC’s portfolio of assets to provide a solid foundation for organic and inorganic growth the continued facility uptime and reservoir performance in IPC’s areas of operation the proposed Vert La Gravelle development project, including drilling, and other organic growth opportunities in France, including the Villeperdue West project the status of the suspension of operations at the Grandpuits refinery, and the related effects on production and sales, in France the proposed third phase of infill drilling in Malaysia and the ability to mature additional locations, and the production uplift from such drilling the drilling of the Keruing prospect in Malaysia and the development options if drilling is successful future development potential of the Suffield operations, including continued and future oil drilling and gas optimization programs and the N2N EOR development project the proposed further conventional oil drilling in Canada, including the ability of such drilling to identify further drilling or development opportunities future development of the Blackrod project, including the land position acquired in May 2019, in Canada the results of the facility optimization program and the work to debottleneck the facilities and injection capability, as well as water intake issues, at Onion Lake Thermal the ability to integrate the assets and operations acquired in the BlackPearl Acquisition, including the ability to accelerate value creation and extend IPC’s reserves life following such acquisition 2019 production range, exit rate, operating costs and capital expenditure estimates potential further acquisition opportunities estimates of reserves estimates of contingent resources estimates of prospective resources the ability to generate free cash flows and use that cash to repay debt and to continue to deleverage and future drilling and other exploration and development activities. Statements relating to ""reserves"" and ""contingent resources"" are also deemed to be forward-looking statements, as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the reserves and resources described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and that the reserves and resources can be profitably produced in the future.  Ultimate recovery of reserves or resources is based on forecasts of future results, estimates of amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management.The forward-looking statements are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by IPC, including expectations and assumptions concerning: prevailing commodity prices and currency exchange rates applicable royalty rates and tax laws interest rates future well production rates and reserve and contingent resource volumes operating costs the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals the performance of existing wells the success obtained in drilling new wells anticipated timing and results of capital expenditures the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out planned activities the timing, location and extent of future drilling operations the successful completion of acquisitions and dispositions the benefits of acquisitions the state of the economy and the exploration and production business in the jurisdictions in which IPC operates and globally the availability and cost of financing, labour and services and the ability to market crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids successfully.Although IPC believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because IPC can give no assurances that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to: the risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general such as operational risks in development, exploration and production delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to reserves, resources, production, revenues, costs and expenses health, safety and environmental risks commodity price and exchange rate fluctuations interest rate fluctuations marketing and transportation loss of markets environmental risks competition incorrect assessment of the value of acquisitions failure to complete or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or dispositions the ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources failure to obtain required regulatory and other approvals and changes in legislation, including but not limited to tax laws, royalties and environmental regulations. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.Additional information on these and other factors that could affect IPC, or its operations or financial results, are included in the MD&A (See ""Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information"" therein), the Corporation's Annual Information Form (AIF) for the year ended December 31, 2018 (See ""Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information"", ""Reserves and Resources Advisory"" and "" Risk Factors"" therein) and other reports on file with applicable securities regulatory authorities, which may be accessed through the SEDAR website (www.sedar.com) or IPC's website (www.international-petroleum.com).Non-IFRS MeasuresReferences are made in this press release to ""operating cash flow"" (OCF), ""Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization"" (EBITDA), ""operating costs"" and ""net debt""/""net cash"", which are not generally accepted accounting measures under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable with definitions of OCF, EBITDA, operating costs and net debt/net cash that may be used by other public companies. Non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.Management believes that OCF, EBITDA, operating costs and net debt/net cash are useful supplemental measures that may assist shareholders and investors in assessing the cash generated by and the financial performance and position of the Corporation. Management also uses non-IFRS measures internally in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, prepare annual operating budgets and assess the Corporation’s ability to meet its future capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Management believes these non-IFRS measures are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they highlight trends in the core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management believes such measures allow for assessment of the Corporation’s operating performance and financial condition on a basis that is more consistent and comparable between reporting periods. The Corporation also believes that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of issuers.The definition and reconciliation of each non-IFRS measure is presented in IPC's MD&A (See ""Non-IFRS Measures"" therein). Disclosure of Oil and Gas InformationThis press release contains references to estimates of gross 2P reserves attributed to the Corporation's oil and gas assets. Gross reserves are the total working interest reserves before the deduction of any royalties and including any royalty interests receivable.Reserves estimates, contingent resource estimates and estimates of future net revenue in respect of IPC’s oil and gas assets in the Suffield area of Canada are effective as of December 31, 2018, and are included in the report prepared by McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd. (McDaniel), an independent qualified reserves evaluator, in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (NI 51-101) and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (the COGE Handbook), and using McDaniel's January 1, 2019 price forecasts.Reserves estimates, contingent resource estimates and estimates of future net revenue in respect of IPC’s oil and gas assets in the Onion Lake, Blackrod and Mooney areas of Canada are effective as of December 31, 2018, and are included in the report prepared by Sproule Associates Limited (Sproule), an independent qualified reserves evaluator, in accordance with NI 51-101 and the COGE Handbook, and using McDaniel's January 1, 2019 price forecasts.The contingent resource estimates in respect of the oil and gas assets acquired in May 2019 in the Blackrod area of Canada are effective as of December 31, 2018, and have been evaluated by Sproule, in accordance with NI 51-101 and the COGE Handbook. The lands acquired will be part of the planned SAGD development at Blackrod and have the same classification (Development on Hold) as the other Blackrod lands. The same chance of development risk (77%) has been applied to the acquired lands as was used for Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the Blackrod project. These lands will be incorporated into the Phase 2 and Phase 3 development plan going forward. Additional details regarding the planned development at Blackrod, including an assessment of the contingencies, timing and economics for the proposed development, are available in the AIF. Reserve estimates, contingent resource estimates, prospective resource estimates and estimates of future net revenue in respect of IPC’s oil and gas assets in France and Malaysia are effective as of December 31, 2018, and are included in the report prepared by ERC Equipoise Ltd. (ERCE), an independent qualified reserves auditor, in accordance with NI 51-101 and the COGE Handbook, and using McDaniel’s January 1, 2019 price forecasts.The price forecasts used in the reserve reports are available on the website of McDaniel (www.mcdan.com), and are contained in the MCR.""2P reserves"" means IPC’s gross proved plus probable reserves. ""Proved reserves"" are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves. ""Probable reserves"" are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves.Contingent resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development, but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies. Contingencies are conditions that must be satisfied for a portion of contingent resources to be classified as reserves that are: (a) specific to the project being evaluated and (b) expected to be resolved within a reasonable timeframe. Contingencies may include factors such as economic, legal, environmental, political, and regulatory matters, or a lack of markets. It is also appropriate to classify as contingent resources the estimated discovered recoverable quantities associated with a project in the early evaluation stage. Contingent resources are further classified in accordance with the level of certainty associated with the estimates and may be sub-classified based on a project maturity and/or characterized by their economic status.There are three classifications of contingent resources: low estimate, best estimate and high estimate. Best estimate is a classification of estimated resources described in the COGE Handbook as being considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will be actually recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 50% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.Contingent resources are further classified based on project maturity. The project maturity subclasses include development pending, development on hold, development unclarified and development not viable. All of the Corporation’s contingent resources are classified as either development on hold or development unclarified. Development on hold is defined as a contingent resource where there is a reasonable chance of development, but there are major non-technical contingencies to be resolved that are usually beyond the control of the operator. Development unclarified is defined as a contingent resource that requires further appraisal to clarify the potential for development and has been assigned a lower chance of development until contingencies can be clearly defined. Chance of development is the probability of a project being commercially viable.References to ""unrisked"" contingent resources volumes means that the reported volumes of contingent resources have not been risked (or adjusted) based on the chance of commerciality of such resources. In accordance with the COGE Handbook for contingent resources, the chance of commerciality is solely based on the chance of development based on all contingencies required for the re-classification of the contingent resources as reserves being resolved. Therefore unrisked reported volumes of contingent resources do not reflect the risking (or adjustment) of such volumes based on the chance of development of such resources.The contingent resources reported in this press release are estimates only. The estimates are based upon a number of factors and assumptions each of which contains estimation error which could result in future revisions of the estimates as more technical and commercial information becomes available. The estimation factors include, but are not limited to, the mapped extent of the oil and gas accumulations, geologic characteristics of the reservoirs, and dynamic reservoir performance. There are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with recovery of such resources, including many factors beyond the Corporation’s control. There is uncertainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the contingent resources referred to in this press release.2P reserves and contingent resources have been aggregated in this press release by IPC. Estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same level of confidence as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties, due to aggregation. This press release contains estimates of the net present value of the future net revenue from IPC's reserves. The estimated values of future net revenue disclosed in this press release do not represent fair market value. There is no assurance that the forecast prices and cost assumptions used in the reserve evaluations will be attained and variances could be material. BOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of 6 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) per 1 barrel (bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.  As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a 6:1 conversion basis may be misleading as an indication of value.CurrencyAll dollar amounts in this press release are expressed in United States dollars, except where otherwise noted.

In line with this, the Board has decided on financial objectivesfor the Group. We shall grow the revenue by more than 5% p.a., including bothorganic as well as acquired growth, with an adjusted EBITA-margin of more than4% in med-ium term. The first quarter started somewhat weak which was accordingto expectations. Revenue declined by 4% and the adjusted EBITA-margin amountedto 4.1% (4.4). During the quarter the competition has become tougher in the B2C-segment compared with the same period previous year. We have also seen theeffects of that we are priori-tizing price before volume in our B2P agreementsin Sweden as well as in Norway. New agreements with more attractive terms willsuccessively replace the old ones, which will benefit transporters and driversbut also contribute in due time to an expected growth in the number of cars.New agreementsPublicly procured travel, such as paratransit taxi services and schooltransports, account for approximately 40% of our business and are of strategicimportance to Cabonline. Less attractive agreements will successively bereplaced during 2019 by newly won contracts with more attractive prices inSweden, Norway and Finland. These new cont-racts provide a favourable foundationfor future revenue in the public sector and predictability since the contractsduration are 3-4 years. They have been negotiated on better terms, which willbenefit both us and our trans-porters in the future with an expected growth inthe number of cars. The new agreements will start to generate effects in stagesas of the second quarter of 2019 when they become effective and less favourablepublic agre-ements are terminated. These agreements constitute a solid base forour future growth.Effective 1 March this year, we successfully launched the new and morecomprehensive assignment of patient transportation in Oslo. The agreement is fortwo years with a two-year extension option. The new agreements concerningparatransit taxi services procured last autumn by the traffic administration inStockholm County Council started the new assignment on 1 April. The assignmentcorresponds to a total value of nearly SEK 3 billion in four years.We also had successes in several other public-sector procurements in Sweden andin Finland which together have revenues of around 200 MSEK and often with aduration of 3-4 years.Scalable platformThe start of the year was intensive. In addition to the core of our business –driving 45,000 customers to their destin-ations – we continued work to build awell-functioning and scalable platform for growth. Important features for thiswork is about internal processes and routines in order to strengthen thecompetence within the organisation. During the first quarter we also recruitedkey personnel within marketing, legal affairs, public-sector procurement, IT andcustomer service. These initiatives are done with the ambition to strengthen ourability to continue grow with profitability in order to become more attractivefor our existing customers and be able to win more public-sector procurementsand corporate agreements. Through additional acquisitions, we are strengtheningour geographic presence which at the same time increase our availability for ourcustomers.New acquisitionsWe are fulfilling our acquisition strategy and establishing a presence inmarkets in which Cabonline has not previously been active. We recently acquiredTaxi Västerås with 148 cars which we will take over as of May 2019.We have also taken a step into the Danish market through the acquisition of Taxi4x27 with around 300 vehicles. The Danish taxi market is currently undergoinggradual deregulation and is expected to expand in the next few years. As theleading taxi company in the Nordic region, it is therefore important for us toestablish a strategic platform in Denmark from which we can grow in the future.Initiative in FinlandWe have also worked intensively to develop the business of Cabonline Finland,particularly ahead of and after the deregulation that became legally effectiveon 1 July last year. Our foremost challenge is to attract more drivers in afiercely competitive market and we have to continue to focus on this issue inthe future. A new CEO has been recruited to Cabonline Finland, Kati Rajala, whowill take office on 1 June. Kati will continue work on eventually creating astrong position in the Finnish market.Together with our initiatives over the past year to develop a stronger corporateculture and Group-wide leadership, we are now better equipped to achieve ourobjectives, grow with profitability and realise our target scenario: a world-class taxi company.Peter ViinapuuPresident and CEOFor further information, please contact:Peter Viinapuu, CEO, tel +46766411006Olof Fransson, CFO, tel +46705172022This information is such that Cabonline Group Holding AB (publ) is obliged todisclose in accordance with the EU’s Market Abuse Regulation.

Concentric AB,2019-05-07 08:00:00,"FIRST QUARTER  ·  Net sales: MSEK 566 (603) – sales were down –6% y-o-y.

Other effects per31 March were total assets MSEK +99 net debt MSEK +102 gearing ratio +8%.President and CEO, David Woolley, comments on Q1 2019 Interim Report.Sales developmentPublished market indices suggest production rates, blended to the Group’s end-markets and regions were up by 5% year-on-year in the first quarter. Whilst ourcustomers’ end markets grew, they have managed risk and reduced stocks duringthe first quarter, which means their tier 1 suppliers sales have not grown tothe same extent. Group sales for the first quarter were down year-on-year by 12%in constant currency reflecting the decision by a customer, a global OEM, todual source components during 2019 and is broadly in line with previousguidance. Excluding sales to the global OEM from both periods, group sales wereconstant for the first quarter year-on-year. The continued sustained demand inthe first quarter is evident both in our core regions of North America andEurope, as well in all four sectors we serve, notably truck, and equipment forconstruction and agriculture. The largest end sector for Concentric continued tobe trucks, representing 42% of the Group’s sales, concentrated primarily inNorth America and Europe. Market demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks inNorth America grew by 5% year-on-year in the first quarter, whilst Europeandemand continued with low single digit growth. India reported strong marketgrowth in the first quarter but was probably the market most affected bypressure to reduce stocks. Sales to the Agricultural Machinery end sectorremained strong predominantly in the Americas and India. However, theConstruction Equipment end sector proved more challenging, particularly in NorthAmerica and Europe as our customers adjusted stock levels to a more uncertainoutlook.Concentric Business ExcellenceThe key objectives of the Concentric Business Excellence programme (“CBE”) areto achieve absolute satisfaction of our customers and employees. The CBEprogramme has enabled the teams to efficiently reduce our cost of capacity andoutput to meet current demand, optimising our operational cost base. The CBE-programme has managed to defend the Group’s operating income levels, reportingan operating margin for the first quarter of 22.2% (19.9).Concentric wins important contracts for next generation steering systemsConcentric AB has won five Electro-Hydraulic Steering (“EHS”) systems contractsworth an estimated total of SEK 94 million over the next five years. Thecontracts relate to EHS systems to be used in electric trucks as well as hybridand electric buses. Even though these platforms currently constitute a smallniche, local city regulation and customer requirements will drive increaseddemand for electric commercial vehicles going forward. These nominations aretherefore strategically important and we believe that the electric segmentpresents exciting long-term opportunities for Concentric.Acquisition OpportunitiesWe continue to explore acquisition opportunities that will offer eithergeographical expansion, product expansion or technologies that will enhance ourcurrent engine and hydraulic product lines to provide us with an even greaterpresence alongside our global customers.OutlookThe underlying sales order book remains strong and the level of orders receivedin the ﬁrst quarter indicate that sales in the second quarter 2019 will bebroadly in line with sales in the ﬁrst quarter. Market indices predict thatproduction volumes blended to Concentric’s end-markets and regions will be up 4%year-on-year for 2019, which is lower than the 7% growth rate in 2018. Ourexpectation remains that demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, particularlyin North America could weaken towards the end of 2019 and the business isvigilant to the change in customer behaviour such as destocking and is ready toadapt to any market changes. Concentric remains well positioned both financiallyand operationally, to fully leverage our market opportunities.For further information, please contact:David Woolley (President and CEO) or Marcus Whitehouse (CFO) atTel: +44 121 445 6545 or E-mail: info@concentricab.comThe information in this report is of the type that Concentric AB is obliged tomake public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the SecuritiesMarkets Act.

But in spite of thedrop in oil price achieved, free cash generation has remained strong and weadded close to MUSD 10 to our already solid cash position and ended the quarterwith more than MUSD 80 in cash after paying our share of investments on theblocks, which included drilling more than ten wells. A fact that trulyunderscores the robustness of our core Omani asset! A fact that is furtheremphasized by our record distribution proposal: we propose to the annual generalmeeting a dividend and share redemption of MSEK 274 (approximately MUSD 28.9),of which MSEK 240 (approximately MUSD 25.3) is payable in the second quarter2019.ProductionProduction was at the lower end of our expectations in the first quarter 2018primarily due to capacity issues at the new Ulfa field production facility,which were not resolved until late in the quarter. Despite these constraints,production amounted to 11,901 bopd and is up compared to the daily averageproduction for 2018!Operating expensesAt the end of 2018 we saw an increase in operating expenses due to higher costsin the older parts of the Farha, Saiwan and Shahd fields and from thecommencement of production operations from new fields. Following these highercosts, we expect operating expenses per barrel in 2019 to be higher than the USD10.7 recorded for 2018. However, the operating expenses for the first quarter of2019 were impacted by certain one-off costs and carry-overs from 2018, and this,along with the constraints to production, resulted in operating expenses perbarrel of USD 13.3. With higher production expected in the coming quarters, andoperating expenses returning to their forecasted levels, we anticipate that theoperating expenses per barrel will decrease towards the levels seen in 2018.First quarter financials in focusFollowing the lower oil price combined with an unchanged production, ourfinancial results decreased during the quarter. We report revenues and otherincome of MUSD 32.7, down 26 percent compared with the fourth quarter 2018. OurEBITDA amounted to MUSD 17.2, down 44 percent compared with the fourth quarter2018. During the quarter, cash flow from operations amounted to MUSD 21.7 andinvestments in oil and gas amounted to MUSD 11.6. Our net cash positionincreased from MUSD 73.1 to MUSD 82.7. The result for the period amounted toMUSD 6.4, down from MUSD 19.9 in the fourth quarter 2018.Oil price environmentAs Tethys Oil’s oil sales price is calculated with an effective two-month lag tospot prices, we experienced, as expected, the lower prices from end of 2018during the first quarter 2019. Our sales price dropped from USD 77.9 per barrelin the fourth quarter 2018 to USD 61.6 per barrel in the first quarter 2019. InJanuary 2019, the prices rebounded, and oil prices we see in the second quarterare almost 10 percent higher than in the first quarter 2019.Exploration drilling on Block 3&4To top the mixed quarter off we even had mixed exploration results. One nearfield Ulfa/Samah analogue drilled as the Masarrah-1 well resulted in a discoverywhich now will undergo a long-term production test and has every sign of turninginto a new midsized Blocks 3&4 field. A far field prospect targeting a non-proven play, the Mahamid-1 well, yielded mixed results. Oil was not encounteredin the target formation, but as frequently is the case on Blocks 3&4 onshoreOman, oil was encountered at shallower levels on the way down. The significanceof the oil shows in Mahamid-1 are not yet clear, but given the location of thewell, just finding oil in this area could turn out to be very interestingindeed.Exploration remains an important part of the year’s work programme withsignificant seismic acquisitions planned and the drilling of at least three newexploration wells.Block 49In our 100 percent owned and operated Block 49, onshore western Oman we havejust received parts of the processed data from the seismic acquisition conductedin the fourth quarter 2018. Our Block 49 exploration activity for the nextcouple of months will focus on interpreting that data with a view to findingdrillable prospects. We will know much more by the time of the report for thesecond quarter 2019.So stay with us, we are confident that the coming quarters will have a bettermix.Stockholm in May 2019Magnus NordinManaging DirectorFor further information, please contact:Magnus Nordin, managing director, phone: +46 8 505 947 00Jesper Alm, CFO, phone: +46 8 505 947 00Conference callDate: 7 May 2019Time: 10.00 CETTo participate in the conference call, you may choose one of the followingoptions:Link to webcast: https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/qannon33To participate via phone, please call:Sweden: +46 8 566 426 51 / PIN: 69756366#Switzerland: +41 225 809 034 / PIN: 69756366#UK: +44 333 300 0804 PIN: 69756366#United States (Toll-Free): +1 855 857 0686 PIN: 69756366#This information is information that Tethys Oil AB (publ) is obliged to makepublic pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

We have reported continued profitablerevenue growth and healthy Viaplay subscriber intake.”Q1 was a historic quarter for NENT. We set our purpose and values, published ourprospectus, held our first capital markets day, met a wide range of investors,and listed our shares on Nasdaq Stockholm. This was all achieved while at thesame time growing our sales, profits and subscriber base.This is possible because of the efforts of the greatest asset we have - ourworld class team. We are continuing to build a company that is very wellpositioned to benefit from technological innovation and the changes in consumerbehaviour. We are well on our way to be the leading streamed entertainmentprovider in the Nordics, and a Nordic storyteller appealing to global audiences.NENT is a unique play on the Nordic streaming market. Scaling Viaplay is thebest way to drive long-term shareholder value, and we intend to do so whilecontinuing to deliver profitable growth.Our debut quarterly report as a separately listed company saw organic sales up6%, segmental operating income up 11% and the addition of 99k Viaplay payingsubscribers. Operating income before IAC was up marginally as we now have thehigher central operating costs of being a standalone and listed company, whichwill impact fully in Q2.Our Broadcasting & Streaming operations delivered 7% top and bottom line growth.Subscription & Other sales, which accounted for 63% of group sales, were up 9%due to high Viaplay subscriber growth as well as the sale of selective contentrights to third parties. Advertising sales, which accounted for 26% of groupsales, were up 2% with healthy sales growth in both Viafree and Swedish Radiooffset by softer ad markets in Norway.We have recently announced a number of important pan-Nordic content agreementssuch as the exclusive coverage of Alpine and Cross Country skiing from 2021,IndyCar racing until 2021, the Open golf championship until 2024, as well asmovies and series from MGM and NBCU. We have also announced 9, and premiered 3,new Viaplay Originals and will premiere at least 20 this year. We have alsosigned a series of large scale and long-term strategic distribution partnershipsin Denmark.NENT Studios sales were up 28%, which accounted for 11% of group sales,following the higher scripted production volumes and the operating loss wassignificantly reduced in what is a seasonally weak quarter.NENT Group remains very well positioned to drive and benefit from the shift toon-demand and online viewing. Our content offering is unrivaled and is gettingeven stronger. It is monetised across multiple platforms and windows, and makesNENT a formidable local Nordic leader and challenger to global competition.Anders JensenPresident & CEOShareholder information2019 Annual General MeetingThe 2019 Annual General Meeting will be held on Wednesday 22 May 2019 inStockholm.The Board proposes a dividend of SEK 6.50 per share to be paid out to theshareholders in two equal instalments of SEK 3.25 each.

Railcare Group AB,2019-05-07 07:30:00,"A positive start to 2019First quarter[1]  ·  Consolidated net sales increased by 27.7 per cent to SEK 84.9 million(66.5).  ·  Operating profit (EBIT) increased by SEK 5.4 million to SEK 10.4 million(5.0).  ·  Earnings per share after dilution amounted to SEK 0.31 (0.13).Significant events in the first quarter  · Railcare has received an order to build a new generation of generator wagonsfor railroad entrepreneur company Infranord. The order value amounts toapproximately SEK 30 million and the order comprises a total of five wagons,designed in collaboration with Infranord.  · Railcare has signed a framework agreement with Trafikverket regarding trackwork throughout Sweden. The agreement is valid for a period of two years with anoption for an extension by two additional years.  · Railcare plans to manufacture an emission-free battery-powered MPV (Multi-Purpose Vehicle) – a highly versatile rail maintenance vehicle. A prototypewill be built and tested at Railcare’s Skelleftehamn workshop in 2019, withcompletion estimated in the latter half of the year.CEO’s commentsFor the first quarter of the year, we reported an operating profit (EBIT) of SEK10.4 million and a turnover of SEK 84.9 million, which gives an operating marginof 12.2 per cent. We have achieved good sales and earnings in the followingsegments, Construction Sweden, Transport Scandinavia and Construction Abroad.In comparison with the first quarter of the previous year, we have achieved botha higher volume and result. The volume growth of 28 per cent is mainly a resultof increased volumes for the Transport Scandinavia segment, with the Kaunis Ironproject to transport iron ore along with the increased utilisation in the UK.The Construction Sweden segment has had full utilisation of the machines andpersonnel for the project that we carried out for Trafikverket up until andincluding 15 March with the snow removal in Stockholm, Hallsberg, andGothenburg. The snow machines have also been redirected to other snowy areas innorthern Sweden for optimal utilisation. After a few days of disassembly of snowequipment, we had an early start to the seasonal work with four machines from 18March working on cable lowering for the track replacement work in 2019 for theroutes Eskilstuna – Flen, and Strångsjö – Simonstorp. In the framework agreementthat has been signed with Trafikverket, we have received eight call-offs onvarious track replacement projects, meaning we now have a fully booked orderbook until the snow project starts again on 15 November 2019.Transport Scandinavia had a good quarter with increased growth and earnings. Thetransport of iron ore for Kaunis Iron goes according to plan and creates a goodfoundation and stability for the segment since the agreement with Kaunis Iron isfor five years. In other operations, five locomotives have been involved in thesnow contract with Trafikverket, two locomotives are on long-term rental toNorway and the locomotive workshop in Långsele is busy. In March, we performedtransports in connection with the large Swedish army exercise, Northern Wind.Overall, compared to the first quarter of the previous year, we have a growth of61 per cent, and a profit of SEK 2 million, which is SEK 4 million better. Acontract has also been signed for four locomotives undertaking track replacementprojects for the Eskilstuna – Flen route this summer.We also had a good start to the year in the Construction Abroad segment. We haveincreased utilisation and call-off orders for the four Railvac’s we have in theUK, despite being the end of the business plan's period CP5. Many projects havebeen carried out on the following routes London North West, London North East &Midlands and Scotland. On 1 April, the new business plan CP6 started, and theperiod will continue for five years. The framework agreement with Network Railhas been extended by one year and in connection with this agreement, we havesucceeded in negotiating more reasonable conditions for when the customercancels projects at short notice. With the new conditions, we will receivepayment if the machine is cancelled within 4 weeks, this was previously 24hours, resulting in large costs for Railcare.In our Nordic neighbouring country, we will rent out a Railvac includingoperators to Norway from May until November 2019. As a result of low demand inFinland, we have decided to transport the machine to Sweden, but retain theFinnish boogies and thus maintaining high flexibility. In Denmark, we will rentout locomotives as previously.Within the Machine Sales segment, work is underway in the workshop inSkelleftehamn with the construction of the five generator wagons which Infranordhas ordered for delivery in 2019 and 2020. The workshop is designing anddeveloping the construction of the innovation MPV (Multi-Purpose Vehicle), anemission-free battery-powered unit for several areas of use. In addition, we areworking on building two new Ballast Feeder machines that will be in productionin Sweden during the spring.We have high activity in our export business and have sent several quotes aroundthe world. Also within the segment, regular aftermarket sales to North Americacontinues.With the historically large railway investment that has been decided and nowbeing implemented in Sweden, the start of the new business plan CP6 in the UK,several quotes on machine sales to potential customers around the world, andmany important contracts signed, it is a good start to 2019, and looksundeniably exciting for the future.With innovative solutions for the railway and with our staff as the primaryresource, we build the future for Railcare.Daniel ÖholmCEOThis information is information that Railcare Group AB is obliged to make publicpursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

Scandic Hotels Group AB,2019-05-07 07:30:00,"First quarter in summary  · Net sales rose by 7.3% to 4,066 MSEK (3,791). Organic growth was 4.7% whilesales for comparable units grew by 2.5%. More rooms in operation contributedwith 2.2% to sales growth.  · The 2019 Easter holiday fell in April, which is why the quarter is not fullycomparable with the first quarter 2018. Calendar effects are estimated to haveimpacted net sales positively by 3 to 4% due to the late Easter.  · Adjusted EBITDA increased to 160 MSEK (115), corresponding to a margin of3.9% (3.0).  · Divestment of Scandic Hasselbacken in Stockholm for 230 MSEK.

Excluding effects fromfinance leases, earnings per share totaled 0.87 (-1.31).  · Net results for the quarter were positively impacted by items affectingcomparability, mainly attributable to capital gains from the sale of ScandicHasselbacken. Excluding items affecting comparability and the effect of financeleases, earnings per share amounted to -0.79 (-1.13).CEO’s comments in summaryDemand for hotel nights continued to grow in our markets in the beginning of theyear, but increased capacity growth in some destinations had a dampening impact,especially in the Oslo region where several new hotels opened during thequarter.Organic sales growth was 4.7% with just over half due to growth in comparableunits. Sales were positively affected by the late Easter in 2019. Adjusted forthat, sales and RevPAR for comparable units were marginally lower than in thecorresponding quarter last year.During the first quarter, which seasonally is Scandic’s weakest, adjusted EBITDAimproved in all segments except Sweden.We were satisfied with the development of the Restel portfolio at the beginningof the year. It is gratifying to see a clear effect of the cost synergies weachieved during the second half of 2018. During the quarter, RevPAR roseslightly for the Restel hotels as a whole, and we see continued potential tostrengthen both occupancy and average room rates.We’ve stepped up the pace of our work to increase efficiency. Scandic has astrong market position and scalable business model, but we need to be moreselective in our priorities and we have increased our focus on the unprofitableparts of our business.We have a long-term positive outlook on our markets although higher capacity atsome destinations may have a temporary negative effect on the market balance in2019. There is new capacity in Oslo, and there will be an increase in Copenhagenduring 2019.We do not expect major changes in market conditions during the second quarter.For Q2, we expect sales growth for comparable units of between -2 and -3%,including a negative calendar effect of around 3% For the first six months ofthe year, we expect sales growth for comparable units of between 0 and -1% Inaddition, having more rooms in operation is expected to contribute approximately2% to net sales.Jens MathiesenPresident & CEOThis information is information that Scandic Hotels Group AB is obliged to makepublic pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

Bravida Holding AB,2019-05-07 07:30:00,"Strong growth and solid earnings  · Net sales increased by 10% to SEK 5,013 million (4,557)  · Organic growth was 5% (1)  · The order backlog was 24% higher at SEK 13,474 million (10,825)  · EBITA increased by 11% to SEK 251 million (226)  · The EBITA margin was 5.0% (5.0)  · Profit after tax was SEK 178 million (168)  · Basic earnings per share were SEK 0.88 (0.83) and diluted earnings per sharewere SEK 0.88 (0.83)  · Cash flow from operating activities was SEK 414 million (58)  · Net debt amounted to SEK 2,115 million (1,841)  · Five acquisitions were completed in the quarter, adding annual sales ofapproximately SEK 345 million  · From 1 January 2019 IFRS 16 is being applied to the Group’s leases and allfigures for 2019 include this change. This change increased EBITA by SEK 3million, while finance costs have increased by SEK 5 million. Closing net debthas increased by SEK 980 million. Previous periods have not been restated andare reported according to IAS 17.CEO statementBravida delivered strong growth and solid earnings for the first quarter of2019. The order backlog is at a record level and cash flow for the last 12months is well over our financial target. Priority objectives for Bravida are togrow in the service segment and to be a market leader in all locations where weare present. So far this year our service business continued to grow and tenacquisitions have been made, strengthening our local market position.Good organic growth and solid earningsBravida is reporting organic growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. As aresult of good growth in Norway, Denmark and ­Finland we achieved growth of 10percent in the quarter, 5 percent of which was organic. Service sales rose by 7percent, which is decent as service assignments are generally recurring.Earnings performance was solid, with improvements in ­Sweden, Denmark andFinland. Earnings in Norway declined, which was due to write-downs on two largeprojects that were included in the order backlog when we acquired Oras. Finalsettlement for these projects will take place in the second quarter of 2019.In Sweden we improved the EBITA margin through a higher gross profit marginowing to good cost control in our project activities. In Denmark the EBITAmargin improved as a result of relatively lower administrative costs. Owing toboth good organic growth and acquisitions, we are continuing to approachcritical mass in Finland, which also resulted in an improved EBITA margin.Strong cash flowCash conversion was 131 percent, which is significantly above our target. Cashflow from operating activities was SEK 414 million.Acquisitions continue to strengthen BravidaBravida’s growth and market position in both service and installation continueto strengthen through acquisitions. So far this year Bravida has acquired tencompanies, five of which were acquired after the end of the quarter. Theacquisitions add annual sales of just over SEK 600 million. It’s very pleasingthat we have increased the pace of acquisitions in Denmark, where we have madefive acquisitions so far in 2019.

Following thetransformative changes that were made last year, it is gratifying to note thatthe new organization is now working focused, efficiently and thoroughly with thecompany's clinical portfolio and business development. The changes that weremade last year also enabled us to reduce the running costs in the business goingforward. We estimate that our goal, that these costs will amount to one third oftheir previous level, will be reached in the third quarter.Let me summarize the status of our clinical portfolio.Remetinostat is our topical HDAC inhibitor being developed for the treatment ofmycosis fungoides, the most common form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, a rareform of blood cancer that occurs first in the skin. We are now developing thephase III design based on the clarifications we received from the FDA at the endof last year. We intend to seek a partner for the continued development andcommercialization of remetinostat.In our collaboration with Stanford University School of Medicine in California,a trial-initiated phase II study with remetinostat in patients with basal cellcancer is ongoing.Birinapant is Medivir's SMAC mimetic that is being developed in combination withMSD's anti-PD-1 treatment Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) for patients with solidtumors. The study, which is performed at several clinics, mainly in the UnitedStates, has an open single-arm design and is performed in two parts. The initialdose escalation part of the study (phase I) showed a positive safety profile andin addition, an interesting effect signal was noted on one of the patients withmicrosatellite-stable (MSS) colorectal cancer, a cancer form in which treatmentwith Keytruda® alone very rarely gives effect.The inclusion of the first colorectal cancer patient in the phase II part of thestudy took place just before Christmas. This study evaluates preliminaryefficacy as well as continued safety and tolerability of birinapant incombination with Keytruda® in patients with colorectal cancer. A futilityanalysis of the study is planned for Q4 2019.Under our agreement with Merck & Co, they provide Keytruda® to Medivir at nocost. Medivir retains all rights to birinapant as well as to the data generated.MIV-818 is Medivir's nucleotide prodrug that is being developed for thetreatment of liver cancer. In an ongoing phase I study, six patients havealready been included. The purpose of this first-in-human study is to studysafety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of MIV-818 in patients with advancedcancer in the liver, a fatal disease with very few available treatment options.We expect the results from the first part of the phase I study to be availablefor analysis during Q2 2019.At the end of last year, Medivir's proprietary substance MIV-828 was selected ascandidate drug for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other formsof blood cancer. MIV-828 is a nucleotide-based prodrug designed to overcome theresistance mechanisms that can inhibit the effects of nucleoside analoguescurrently used for the treatment of AML.For MIV-711, Medivir's cathepsin K inhibitor for the treatment ofosteoarthritis, we were able to present very positive phase II data last year.The FDA's new preliminary guidelines for the development of disease-modifyingosteoarthritis treatments open up for structural influence as an endpoint inclinical studies and for the possibility of obtaining so-called ""Acceleratedapproval"". Medivir continues to aim at establishing a license or cooperationagreement for MIV-711.The organization has quite recently recruited a new CFO, Magnus Christensen. Hejoins in August to a team with broad expertise and experience of both drugdevelopment and business development. Together, we work hard and diligently,developing our candidate drugs in the right direction in order to improvetreatment for patients with great medical needs and thus ultimately create greatvalues for our shareholders.Uli HacksellPresident and CEOThis report has not been subject to auditors' review.The information was submitted for publication at 08.30 CET on 3 May 2019."
Midsona AB,2019-05-03 08:15:00,"Sales growth and improved EBITDA driven by acquisitions and prioritised brandsJanuary-March 2019 (first quarter)  · Net sales amounted to SEK 786 million (610).  · EBITDA amounted to SEK 73 million (57) before items affecting comparability,corresponding to a margin of 9.3 percent (9.3).  · Profit for the period was SEK 4 million (39), corresponding to earnings pershare of SEK 0.08 (0.85) before and after dilution.  · Free cash flow amounted to SEK -42 million (-4).  · Restructuring costs for an efficiency programme for the Group’s Nordicoperations were charged to the period’s earnings in an amount of SEK 25 million.Significant event following the end of the report period  · Long-term financial targets were revised and adopted for the Group by the Boardof Directors of Midsona AB (publ).Comments by the CEOIncreased sales and improved EBITDAMidsona’s sales rose by 29 percent to SEK 786 million (610). EBITDA before itemsaffecting comparability improved to SEK 73 million (57). Solid sales growth forthe Group’s prioritised brands and an IFRS 16 effect impacted earningspositively while a continued unfavourable exchange rate trend and the conclusionof the distribution assignment for Alpro impacted earnings negatively.Growth for prioritised brandsMidsona increased its focus on the Group’s eight prioritised brands. These grewby 6 percent* in the quarter, where the trend for Friggs was especially strong,achieving double-digit growth by a good margin. Focused brand work over a longtime has resulted in continuously increasing volumes. A success factor has beenthe launch of new products. During the quarter, Friggs Popcorn corn cake waslaunched and was well received by customers and consumers. Another successfactor was launching Friggs outside the home market of Sweden. Growth wasparticularly strong in Finland and Norway in the quarter.The work of strengthening competitiveness for Midsona’s organic brandscontinued. A number of new products were launched, including the “Happy Crunch”series under the Davert brand. They are the first products from MidsonaGermany’s (formerly Davert) new production lines focused on breakfast products.In Sweden, Kung Markatta launched a series of plant-based organic beverages.Focus on acquisitionsMidsona has consolidated the Nordic market for health and well-being throughacquisitions. Backed by a market-leading Nordic platform, it was natural to liftour sights towards the rest of Europe. In May 2018, we took the step into theworld’s second largest market for organic foods, Germany, in connection with theacquisition of Midsona Germany. Integration has gone according to plan and wecan note that our acquisition method also worked outside the Nordic region.Careful analysis, a clear acquisition agenda and a well-developed integrationmodel are important ingredients in Midsona’s acquisition recipe. We have nowcome so far in the integration of Midsona Germany that we are ready for newacquisitions. When they will take place is an open question, however, since wehave a lot of patience to be able to acquire the right company at the rightprice. However, I am personally working on it and have the goal of being able topresent new acquisitions as soon as possible.Revised financial targetsThe Board of Midsona AB has decided to revise the Group’s financial targets.Midsona has the ambition to actively participate in the consolidation of theEuropean market for health and well-being. At the same time, the Group willdeliver organic growth for prioritised brands through an effective marketcultivation and innovation. The Board has therefore chosen to revise the growthtarget up to 15.0 percent per year from the previous target of 10.0 percent. Aclear focus on profitability through efficiency enhancements and synergicacquisitions will increase the EBITDA margin from a historic 9.0–10.0 percent toat least 12.0 percent. With an active acquisition agenda, debt will be at3.0–4.0 times EBITDA as long as we continue to make acquisitions. The dividendtarget is left unchanged. The new targets are:  · Net sales growth of >15.0 percent through organic growth and acquisitions.  · EBITDA-margin >12.0 percent.  · A ratio between net debt/EBITDA of a multiple of 3.0-4.0.  · A dividend over time of >30.0 percent of profit after tax.Outlook for 2019The foundation that Midsona’s business rests on is the strong trends in people’sgreater interest in health and well-being combined with a clear desire toconsume more sustainably. Demand for plant-based, pure, organic and sustainablefood products is expected to grow in 2019. The main focus during the year willbe to create the best conditions for growth for our brands, but also, in thecases we have available production capacity, to take contracts to produceprivate label brands. In parallel, we will continue to improve the efficiency ofthe Nordic operations and complete the integration of the acquired MidsonaGermany. We are also looking for new acquisitions with the clear ambition ofbecoming one of the leading companies in health and well-being in Europe andthereby achieve our financial targets.Peter Åsberg, President and CEO*The prioritised brand Davert compared with sales in the same period last year,despite Midsona not owning the brand at that time.For more information, please contact MD and CEO Peter Åsberg, telephone +46(0)730 26 16 32, or CFO Lennart Svensson, telephone +46(0)767 74 33 04.This is information of the type that Midsona AB is obligated to make public inaccordance with the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

Attendo AB,2019-05-03 08:00:00,"Attendo shows continued strong growth during an otherwise challenging firstquarter of 2019. There are bright spots in home care operations, sales of newbeds, and high and stable occupancy in mature units. Meanwhile, the result isnegatively affected by stricter staffing requirements in Finland and the highrate of openings of new units.President and CEO Martin Tivéus comments on the report“The start of 2019 has been challenging for Attendo. There are however severalbright spots – we continued to make progress in home care, sales of new bedsincreased, we demonstrated strong growth in own operations and we sustained highand stable occupancy in our mature units. As we announced in March, Attendo hasbeen heavily impacted by the debate on the conditions of care for older peoplein Finland, which led to, among other things, stricter staffing requirementsthat entails higher costs for the company. In addition, we still see marginpressure due to historical decisions regarding the opening pace of new units. Inorder to guarantee a long-term sustainable business where we are still a leaderin quality and innovation, we will better balance the pace in terms ofestablishment of new nursing homes going forward.Net sales increased by 10 percent during the quarter to SEK 2,878 million, whilethe adjusted operating profit amounted to SEK 160 million, a decrease of 15percent. Organic growth remains high in own homes while we see a decrease inoutsourcing especially, as a consequence of several contracts ended at the endof 2018 and early 2019, including some large nursing homes that the City ofStockholm chose to insource.Our strategy to grow organically in own operations complemented by selective,smaller acquisitions, remains unchanged. In total, we opened over 400 new bedsin own operations during the quarter and the total number of beds in ownoperations amounted to nearly 16,000 at the end of the quarter, an increase of20 percent compared with the same period last year. In 2019, we will openapproximately 2,000 beds in own operations, slightly lower than the 2,400 bedsthat we opened in 2018. Due to already existing commitments, an adjustment ofthe opening pace will be visible from 2020. The average occupancy rate iscurrently about 80 percent, comparing to mature units that show an occupancy ofabout 90 percent.Stability in Attendo ScandinaviaOur Scandinavian operations displayed a stable result for the quarter in linewith profits in the previous year. The profit improved in home care, mainly as aconsequence of improved planning and processes and also acquisitions. At thesame time, the marks of last year's restructuring of individual and family careare clearly visible, where we closed down a number of unprofitable operations,as well as the loss of both sales and profits of ended outsourcing contracts.During the quarter, we completed further acquisitions within home care andstarted construction of three new nursing homes with a total of 68 beds. We willalso put great energy into improving our market position in the outsourcingmarket during 2019.Strong growth but squeezed profits in Attendo FinlandOur Finnish operations delivered growth of 30 percent during the quarter, drivenprimarily by new homes in own operations and acquisitions. We opened elevennursing homes during the quarter with a total of 352 beds and startedconstruction of a further nine units with a total of 356 beds.Although we lower the investment pace forward from today's level to achieve abetter balance between growth and profitability, we assess the Finnish market asa continued attractive and important growth market for Attendo. During thequarter, we launched an ambitious action program in Finland following the recentintensive debate on the conditions of care for older people and stricterrequirements from the authorities. The program aims to meet the stricterrequirements and further strengthen quality, employee commitment and customersatisfaction, and includes, among other things, more assistants on weekdays andweekends and extended teams within quality and competence development. As wepreviously announced, we estimate increased costs in Finland of approximatelySEK 200 million in 2019, related to these measures. As our contracts in Finlandexpire, we intend to seek compensation for increased demands in negotiationswith the municipalities. We expect a gradual price compensation, although theoutlook for adjustments is limited in 2019.Prioritised areas for 2019As the leading private care provider in the Nordics, we work according to threefundamental objectives: to maintain high and stable technical quality of care sothat our customers and local authorities have confidence in us to achieve thehighest customer satisfaction in every location and to provide more care formoney spent than municipalities’ own alternatives. By meeting these objectives,we are creating value for our customers and the society in which we operate. Ahigh level of trust and preference among local authorities, residents and theirrelatives is creating the long-term conditions for growth as well as high andstable occupancy in our units, thus also creating value for our shareholders.Our focus areas in 2019, linked to our main objectives, are to strengthen ourposition as the leading provider of care in terms of quality and customersatisfaction, ensure a better balance between growth and profitability goingforward and restore trust in the Finnish market. As a step to further improvequality and monitoring of care services, we continued the roll-out of our mobileservice planning and documentation system during the quarter at our homes inScandinavia. We have also allocated additional resources to values initiativesat the units and have begun a review of our quality improvement system andskills development model, where the goals are to increase customer satisfactionand our attractiveness as an employer.Finally, having concentrated the business, including the establishment of twoseparate business areas, we are introducing segment reporting where the twobusiness areas, Attendo Scandinavia and Attendo Finland, are reportedseparately. We are also presenting occupancy rates and profitability in matureunits. We hope the new reporting will make it easier to understand both short-term trends and Attendo’s long-term potential. “Summary of the first quarter 2019  · Net sales increased by 10 percent to SEK 2,878m (2,624).

The high growthwas mainly driven by the acquisition completed last October. Growth incontinuing operations, adjusted for currency and acquisitions was 3 per cent.EBITDA increased 17 per cent with about half of this increase due to change inaccounting standards. Both sales and EBITDA were materially positively impactedby the recent acquisition and negatively impacted by temporary factors. These weexpect to fade away during the year. Market conditions remained generallyfavourable and the underlying business performed in line with plans with severalnew contracts under implementation.In the Steriles & Inhalation segment we continued to see inhalation sales betterthan plan. We have made good progress to overcome the technical and supplyissues for certain injectables that we saw in the fourth quarter. In Italy wehad a planned standstill to reconfigure certain manufacturing suites to preparefor implementation of new contracts.We are implementing several new contracts with associated tech-transfer andscale-up expenses in the Solids & Others segment. While segment sales growth wasgenerally good, we saw materially softer demand of several products that haverecently changed ownership.Our global development services gained business momentum in the quarter andcontributed to growth and improved performance in the Development & Technologysegment.Strong sales growth without increased working capital contributed to a healthyoperating cash flow and a further strengthening of the balance sheet. During thequarter the material serialisation capital expenditure project was completed,and the service implemented with relevant customers. Increased EBITDA and lowerinvestments had a favourable impact on leverage and gearing ratios.The markets we operate in remain competitive but at the same time providing bothgrowth and new business and acquisition opportunities. Going forward I expectour growth-driving strategies, including optimisation and improvements of ourstructure, to continue to deliver.We have invested heavily in capacities where demand is expected to be high.

Q-Linea AB,2019-05-03 07:30:00,"Final version of ASTar shows favourable results and garners positive receptionQuarter: January–March 2019  · Net sales amounted to SEK 0.4 million (0.3).  · The operating result totalled SEK -36.7 million (-23.9).  · The company reported a loss after tax of SEK -36.3 million (-24.0).  · Earnings per share amounted to SEK -1.59 (-2.06).  · Cash flow from operating activities totalled SEK -41.0 million (-25.7).  · At 31 March 2019, cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 20.6 million(354.4).

Although the European market islarger than the US market, we expect a significantly higher growth rate and gaina faster foothold in the US, which is why we are prioritising this market. Whentalking with potential partners, we have seen that certain players have a heavyfocus on the US, making our new strategy an even better fit with theiroperations.The most important annual conference for Q-linea is the European Congress ofClinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases (ECCMID), which was held inAmsterdam on 13–16 April. We spent the first quarter preparing for theconference and, as promised, were able to present the final design of ASTar intwo pre-production systems. We developed a common antibiotics panel for the USand EU markets, featuring a broad antibiotics panel with a large concentrationinterval. We also presented the ability to use ASTar as a semi-automatic systemfor analysing isolates. Both of these develop-ments were presented at ECCMID andbeing able to present the final design of the system to potential customers wasa true milestone for the company.We carried out a number of usability studies during the quarter and presented anew graphical inter-face at ECCMID that will make using ASTar even simpler thanbefore, with a hands-on time of less than one minute. Our previous requirementspecification was less than two minutes, so reducing this time – through closecooperation with potential customers – to less than one minute be a strongselling point as we move forward.Having presented the final design of our ASTar systems – as they will appearwhen they are launched next year – we are now well on schedule, and this was animportant step since customers are already starting to plan their budgets inorder to purchase the system next year. Many visitors expressed their interestin Q-linea during the conference and we are now following up on these leads. Wealso had productive meetings with a number of potential future sales partners.Our very first ASTar customers will be our ambassadors and we plan to workclosely with them during the initial launch phase. We expect to be able to offerthe system at a competitive price for both fully automatic and semi-automaticsample analyses.In summary, the entire company is feeling energised and full of enthusiasm as wecontinue with our important task of preparing ASTar for approval and marketlaunch next year.

MIPS AB,2019-05-03 07:30:00,"JAN - MAR  · Net sales increased by 91% to SEK 44.9m (23.6). Adjusted for currencyexchange rate effects, the increase was 71%  · Operating profit increased to SEK 11.8m (1.8)  · Operating margin increased to 26.3% (7.6)  · Cash flow from operating activities decreased to SEK 7.7m (8.4)  · Earnings per share diluted, amounted to SEK 0.38 (0.07)CEO’S COMMENTSTHE YEAR STARTED OFF STRONGThe year started off strong, with a first quarter that showed substantialimprovements in both sales and profitability. Net sales increased by 91% to SEK44.9m (23.6). Adjusted for currency effects, we grew organically by 71% in thequarter.All helmet categories showed a positive development led by the Snow category.Comparative figures appear more positive since last year's first quarter was asomewhat weaker quarter than the other quarters.Most of the growth came from our existing customers, but we also saw excitinglaunches from new customers during the quarter.We continue to see great interest in all our categories from new customers,while existing customers continue to broaden their product offering with MIPSsolutions.EBIT for the quarter amounted to SEK 11.8m (1.8) and we achieved an operatingmargin of 26.3%.I am very pleased to see that the first quarter, which has historically been ourfinancially weakest, now shows good profitability driven by increased sales.Again, this confirms the scalability of our business model.CONTINUING TO BE THE LEADING TECHNOLOGYThere was a lot of turbulence in the market as our customer Bontrager launched a""new"" technology under the name ""WaveCel"" with bold claimed test results. MIPShas carried out rigorous tests of the technology but has not been able tovalidate the claimed results.We are convinced that MIPS BPS is the leading technology for protection againstrotational movements in the brain.MIPS is unique as an ingredient brand with our ability to work with all brandsand implement our technology in most types of helmets in a cost effective way.It is positive that more and more helmet brands confirm the importance ofreducing the effects of harmful rotational movements, but unfortunately there isstill a lack of an industry-wide standard by an independent testing body, makingit more difficult for both the industry and consumers to compare differenttechnologies.EXCITING LAUNCHES AT TRADE SHOWSAt the world's largest winter trade show, ISPO in Munich, five customers Head,Vola, Cebe, Protec and Flaxta launched their first snow helmets with MIPS BPS.In total, 14 new helmet models equipped with MIPS solutions were launched at thetrade show.We also saw interesting launches in the Equestrian category at a trade show inBirmingham where two customers showed their new helmets with MIPS: Champion andCharles Owen. Together with Charles Owen, MIPS received the award as the bestsafety product.FIRST QUARTER A BIG LEAP TOWARDS 2020With this strong quarter behind us and an active project portfolio, togetherwith new and existing customers, I look forward with confidence to the comingquarters and the continued journey towards our 2020 financial targets.JOHAN THIELPresident and CEO"

Cavotec SA,2019-05-03 07:00:00,"Cavotec SAInterim report (Q1 and Q3)Cavotec SA – Q119 ReportTransformation measures reflected in higher profitability despite lower revenue – continued strong order bookJanuary–March 2019 Order intake decreased 9.3% to EUR 61.6 million (67.9) Order book increased 12.4% to EUR 113.2 million (100.8)Revenues decreased 8.0% to EUR 48.5 million (52.7)EBIT excluding non-recurring items amounted to EUR 2.7 million (2.4), corresponding to a margin of 5.6% (4.6%)Net result for the period was EUR 0.8 million (0.8)Earnings per share basic and diluted amounted to EUR 0.008 (0.011)Operating cash flow amounted to EUR 8.2 million (4.9)Net debt decreased to EUR 6.7 million (FY2018: 32.1)Unless otherwise stated, figures in brackets refer to the same period in the preceding year.Comment from the CEO Higher profitability as transformation pays offIt has now been 18 months since we launched the transformation of Cavotec. A transformation built on preserving the strengths of the company - a very strong sales culture, a strong customer focus and great products that are well positioned in terms of market trends such as automation, sustainability and safety - while addressing our weaknesses, a fragmented structure with weak internal processes which caused inefficiencies and higher costs.We are now a few months into 2019. The major steps of the transformation are now behind us. Through the massive efforts we have put into addressing our weaknesses we have created a strong and steady base to build on and now our focus is on improved profitability. It is with that background encouraging to start to see the return of all the efforts we have made. I’m proud to conclude that all the 50 projects under the A New Day plan designed to streamline processes and transform Cavotec into a more efficient organisation were finalized at the end of the quarter. We have also reduced our headcount by 100 employees compared to a year ago, as part of our restructuring program. These efforts had a positive impact on our profitability already in the first quarter. Adjusted EBIT increased to EUR 2.7 million, corresponding to a margin of 5.6% (4.6% for the same period last year) although revenues decreased 8.0% to EUR 48.5 million. The decrease is mainly due to lower revenues in Airports & Industry, which was not fully compensated by increasing revenues from Ports & Maritime. Airports & Industry performed well in their day-to-day business, but less big projects compared to the first quarter 2018 and several delayed larger projects resulted in lower order intake and revenues for the division compared to the same period previous year.Operating cash flow increased 65.3% to EUR 8.2 million (4.9) as a result of continued improvement in working capital management. In addition, we completed the rights issue in January, which means that we are well positioned to complete our turnaround and be able to invest in growth initiatives. In the first quarter, the Group also adopted the new accounting treatment for Leases, IFRS 16. In summary, the EBITDA for the quarter increased approximately 25% as a consequence, while the impact on the EBIT is not material.We also maintained a good momentum in our sales activities in the quarter, especially within Ports & Maritime. An important order in the quarter was a EUR 10.3 million agreement with a major port operator for a MoorMaster™ automated mooring system, further proof that our technology is gaining traction with ports around the world. While the order intake compared to the same quarter last year was lower, the order book at the end of the quarter stood at EUR 113.2 million, an increase of more than 12%, both compared to the end of 2018 and the first quarter last year.The turnaround of Cavotec is by no means finalized, but we see clear signs of improvements and clearly the transformation is taking hold across the organization. For example, I’m pleased to report that we faced fewer production challenges in Italy than previous quarters thanks to all the efforts that have gone into reconfiguring the facility by the new local management. Late deliveries in Italy have decreased significantly and we expect to see a continued positive development in the second quarter of 2019.During, 2019, our efforts across the group will be centred around two themes, Operational Excellence and Commercial Excellence while we continue to control our costs. We will focus on further improving our operational systems, growing Services as well as meeting our customers’ needs better in order to sell and deliver more, as well as produce an attractive return for our shareholders.By focusing on profitability in 2019 we will ensure that we deeply embed the competitiveness needed to support our growth journey in 2020 and beyond. The market is there, and we will be in a position to capitalize on our customer relationships and the offerings we have.To learn more about our long-term strategy and financial goals we hope to see you at our Investor Information Meeting in Stockholm on 7 May.Lugano, May 3, 2019Mikael NorinChief Executive OfficerENDSFor further details please contact:Johan Hähnel – Investor Relations ManagerMobile: +46 70 605 63 34 – Email: investor@cavotec.comThis is information that Cavotec SA is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

Nobia AB,2019-05-02 08:45:00,"January-March 2019  · Net sales for the first quarter amounted to SEK 3,469 million (3,173).  · Organic growth was a negative 1 per cent (neg: 6).  · Operating profit amounted to SEK 260 million (255), corresponding to anoperating margin of 7.5 per cent (8.0).  · Currency gains had an impact of approximately SEK 5 million on the Group’soperating profit, of which a positive SEK 10 million in translation effects anda negative SEK 5 million in transaction effects.  · Profit after tax amounted to SEK 183 million (193), corresponding toearnings per share after dilution of SEK 1.09 (1.14).  · Operating cash flow amounted to SEK 241 million (64).Comments from the President and CEOGiven the volatile market situation I am overall pleased with the results forthe quarter. Our cost reduction programme is running according to plan andproductivity is gradually recovering in our supply chain. In addition, thesuccessful integration of Bribus is generating solid profit contribution to theGroup.Despite difficult market conditions, sales in the UK remained on the same levelas the previous year. Retail sales improved somewhat on the back of a betterproduct mix, while sales through our improved trade concept continued to grow.We have now trialled the new trade concept in 30 stores over a 6-month periodwith good results, and will thus expand the concept to an additional 120 storesduring the year. Project sales were down in the quarter, but by the end of Marchour London based project business started deliveries to a number of key sitessuch as Southbank Place, Berkeley’s South Quay Plaza and Canary WharfContractors. We expect these to deliver close to SEK 200 million within the nextnine months.In the Nordics our Danish business had good momentum in both project andconsumer sales. I am especially pleased with the performance of our consumersales where the two new kitchen concepts, “New York” and “Nordic Spirit”, haveoutperformed already high sales expectations. We have also modernised the HTHwebsite and started to roll out a revitalised store concept in Denmark duringthe quarter. Sales in Sweden declined in the period on the back of a softerproject market. We currently estimate our Swedish contracts business,representing 5 per cent of Group sales, to have its largest volume drop in Q2/Q3and to stabilise going into Q4.Our reported profit generation was slightly improved versus the same period lastyear, supported by the Bribus acquisition. In addition, higher order values andcontinued reduction in our fixed cost base mitigated continued price pressure inraw materials and logistics. Performance in our supply chain has also stabilisedafter last year’s disruptions, resulting in improved productivity in thequarter.Looking ahead, we believe the high market volatility is likely to continue,especially as a result of Brexit. We are therefore targeting a reduction in ourfixed cost base, but also pushing ahead to make further range reductions andfaster supply chain consolidation in line with previous communication. All inall, I feel confident that these measures will support a continued strongbalance sheet and stable cash flow in the event of a softer global economy. Itwill also give us head room for investments in growth opportunities andpotential M&As, while still keeping dividends in line with our financialtargets.Morten FalkenbergPresident and CEOFor further informationContact any of the following on +46 (0)8 440 16 00:• Morten Falkenberg, President and CEO• Kristoffer Ljungfelt, CFOThis interim report is information such that Nobia is obliged to make publicpursuant to the EU’s Market Abuse Regulation and the Swedish Securities MarketAct.

The conversion has affected EBITDA by SEK 10 m, operating profit(EBIT) by SEK 0 m, and net income by SEK -1 m. The balance sheet total increasedby SEK 137 m.Message from the CEOFirst quarter in line with expectations considering Veg Tech seasonalityConsolidated net sales for the first quarter rose by 20 percent compared withprevious year, from SEK 474 m to SEK 569 m. Acquisitions contributed by 11percent. Organic growth was strong at 5 percent and the currency translationexchange rate effect was 4 percent.At SEK -7 m, EBIT was below last year’s profit of SEK 2 m, and EBITDA was SEK 18m compared with SEK 17 m in the corresponding period in the preceeding year.Earnings are in line with our expectations due to the normal seasonal effect inVeg Tech with very low sales in the winter quarter, as there are almost nodeliveries and installation of green products during the winter period.I am happy to report that our first acquisition this year was finalized inFebruary, further delivering on our commitment to develop our business throughboth organic and acquisitive growth. The leading distributor of pond systems inthe Belgium market, Distri Pond Group, has annual sales of SEK 110 m, and weexpect to expand the business to geographies close to Belgium.The consolidated net sales growth of 20 percent in the first quarter was drivenby strong sales in roofing in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, but also theprefabricated elements business in Norway. While our Products & Solutionsoperating segment reported a sales increase of 21 percent, our InstallationServices operating segment increased 16 percent.Within our Products & Solutions segment, the weather was mixed in the firstquarter and affected our geographies and businesses in various ways. Thebeginning was cold and snowy in Finland, while the latter part of the quarterwas milder and more favourable, especially in Denmark and in the southern partsof Sweden. Sales in Norway develop positively in all segments, but theintensified sales and marketing efforts to increase the market share withinBuilders Merchants has affected gross margin and selling expenses negatively.The prefabricated elements business in Norway continues to develop well andenjoys a strong order book. At the same time, the Danish prefabricated elementsbusiness continues to suffer from the recent trend of construction projectsbeing delayed by our customers. The delays create difficulties in optimizing theproduction planning leading to lower efficiency and earnings. The order intakewas positive in the quarter, but we expect delivery delays to continue in theshort term.For obvious natural reasons, Veg Tech is the most weather dependent and also themost seasonal business within Nordic Waterproofing. The main product is sedum,which just like grass does not grow below a certain temperature. Spring andearly autumn are normally the best times to install sedum, while it is verysensitive to handle at frost and temperatures below zero degrees or the plantscould be damaged. For this reason, deliveries and installation rarely take placeduring the winter months, which is also the case in 2019. This leads to a lossfor Veg Tech in the first quarter, which normally is compensated by the profitespecially in the second and third quarter.Following some improvement in the project execution in our Finnish InstallationServices segment, we are now focusing on receiving new orders and volumeswithout compromising profitability. The general outlook and the Finnish marketexpectations for the year are slightly negative, which makes for a continuouslycompetitive marketplace. However, we have managed to improve the order intakeduring the first quarter compared with previous year, and the order book at theend of the first quarter is above previous year. Our Danish franchise companiesexperience a strong market and perform well in the first quarter, with strongorder books and an EBIT contribution in line with the preceding year.In February we acquired Distri Pond Group. The company, with annual sales ofapproximately SEK 110 million, is a leading distributor of pond systems with aone stop shop offer in the Belgium market, and offers EPDM waterproofingmembranes, pumps, filtering, control systems, light and accessories, andmaintenance & garden applications. Additionally, the company offers sitepreparation, installation of EPDM membranes, education, and technical supportand maintenance. With the acquisition of Distri Pond, Nordic Waterproofing’sbusiness unit SealEco enters the segment of high-quality pond systems. This isin line with Nordic Waterproofing’s strategy of expanding our product andservices portfolio as well as downstream integration. Through the acquisition ofDistri Pond, as in previous recent acquisitions, Nordic Waterproofing furtherdemonstrates and enhances its commitment towards sustainable and environmentallyefficient solutions and surroundings.

In this dynamiclandscape I am pleased to see Zubsolv® maintaining strong sales growth andgreater profit contribution, supporting further enhancement of our pipelinedevelopment.Strong financial performance – US operations reach 44.5 percent EBIT margin(19.3)I am pleased to report the business has achieved a profitable first quarter –the first for the company. This was achieved despite expected high legal costsduring the period. Excluding the litigation costs, EBITDA reached SEK 60.8million (SEK 12.0 million including). Profitability reflects the strong growthin Zubsolv sales in combination with improved gross margins due to acceleratedreduction in cost of goods sold. The EBIT margin in our US operation has nowreached 44.5 percent and contributed to our overall profitability with SEK 71.9million.Market dynamics – Zubsolv sales resilient to increased generic competitionDuring the quarter generic versions of Suboxone Film were launched. We areencouraged to see limited impact on Zubsolv sales, which have remained resilientand stayed at similar levels reported in Q418 and demand increased by 6 percentversus Q118. The main challenge is that some insurers, e.g. Humana and WellCare,who previously didn’t cover Suboxone Film, will now reimburse the genericversions of the drug. Although increased competition can have negative impact onmarket share, the total profit contribution from these insurers often increase,since the rebates are substantially reduced. When the current turmoil hassettled we are confident the market will offer opportunities for Zubsolv.Operational – increasing the pace of pipeline developmentsAs previously announced, we received encouraging data on our OX124 project forthe treatment of opioid overdose with a nasal naloxone formulation. We are nowin a position to progress both OX124 and OX125 (nasal nalmefene formulation),into further clinical studies which will be initiated in 2020. We also receivedpositive in-vivo data for OX338, a sublingual formulation with ketorolac fortreatment of pain, and plan to initiate the first clinical study in humans laterin 2019.Legal – no impact on Zubsolv from the negative decision in the ActavislitigationOrexo is an innovative company and our main product Zubsolv is patent protecteduntil 2032 following a multiyear patent dispute with Actavis. Being aninnovative company also requires a fierce protection of our innovations and weare disappointed with the recent outcome to the litigation process againstActavis for their generics of Subutex® and Suboxone® tablets. We will nowinitiate the first step in an appeal process. This will be associated withsignificantly lower costs than the legal expenses recorded in Q119.Summary and outlookWe have had a strong start to 2019. Three of our four internal pipeline projectsare ready to progress into the next development phase, our financial positioncontinues to strengthen due to sales growth and our manufacturing efficiencyprogram has had significant positive impact on the gross profit contributionfrom Zubsolv. With a continuous improving profit contribution from Zubsolv, weare able to invest more into R&D and business development. The success in theseareas will define our future and on all these areas we have made good progressduring the period.Uppsala, Sweden, May 2, 2019Nikolaj SørensenPresident and CEOFor further information, please contactNikolaj Sørensen, CEO and President, Joseph DeFeo, EVP and CFO or Lena Wange, IR& Communications ManagerTel: +46 18 780 88 00, +1 855 982 7658 Email: ir@orexo.comPresentationAt 2.00 pm CET, the same day as the announcement of the report, Orexo invitesanalysts, investors and media to attend an audiocast with a web presentationwhere Nikolaj Sørensen, CEO, and Joseph DeFeo, CFO, will present the report.After the presentation a Q&A will be held.

DDM Debt AB (publ),2019-05-02 08:00:00,"Highlights first quarter 2019Net collections increased by 72% to EUR 18.1M (Q1 2018 EUR 10.5M)**Cash EBITDA increased by 85% and amounted to EUR 16.4M (Q1 2018: EUR 8.9M)Net loss for the period of EUR 0.5M (Q1 2018: profit of EUR 0.9M)Cash on hand available for investment at the end of March 2019 was EUR 61M (Q42018: EUR 57M)Secured super senior revolving credit facility of EUR 27M significantly loweringthe cost of funding, priced at Euribor plus a margin of 350 basis points andavailable for a period of up to two yearsSale of portfolios in Russia resulted in EUR 2M gainOperational launch of partnership to provide portfolio management services forsecured portfolios in the BalkansSignificant events after the end of the quarterSuccessful refinancing issuing a new EUR 100M senior secured bond with a three-year period replacing the existing EUR 85M bond, priced at Euribor plus amargin of 925 basis pointsInvestment closed phase 1 of the acquisition of a significant corporate securedportfolio in Croatia. Investment made through a 50/50 joint venture withB2Holding, which is expected to fully close during Q2Comment by the CEOThe first months of 2019 have been eventful. We have successfully secured a newRevolving Credit Facility (“RCF”) of EUR 27M at a significantly lower cost offunding with an international bank. Successfully refinanced the existing EUR 85Mbond (after the period) by issuing a new EUR 100M bond, demonstrating ourcontinued ability to access financing. This will improve flexibility, decreasethe cost of capital and in combination with strong collections support ourfuture growth.Net collections increased by 72% compared to the first quarter in 2018 driven bycollections from corporate secured portfolios acquired in 2018 in the Balkansand the collections from the sale of our Russian portfolios. The sale of ourRussian portfolios resulted in a gain of EUR 2M that demonstrates the underlyingvalue of the portfolios, ERC and our dynamic business model that can capitalizeon profitable business opportunities. This has resulted in cash EBITDA of EUR16M, a significant increase of 85% to the corresponding period last year due toboth the increased scalability of DDM’s operations and the strategic shift toinvest primarily in secured portfolios following recent acquisitions.During the quarter we also announced a milestone acquisition through a 50/50joint venture with B2Holding of a distressed asset portfolio containing securedcorporate receivables in Croatia with a Gross Collection Value (face value) ofthe total portfolio amounting to approximately EUR 800M. Phase 1 of thistransaction closed on 30 April 2019 and is expected to fully close during Q2,which will positively impact our ERC and other key financial measurements.Significantly lowering the cost of fundingThe new RCF is available for a period of up to two years and priced at Euriborplus a margin of 350 basis points. After the end of the period we also issued anew EUR 100M senior secured bond with a three-year period, priced at Euriborplus a margin of 925 basis points. The proceeds from the new bond issue willmainly be employed towards refinancing the existing EUR 85M bond issue and forgeneral corporate purposes. Cash on hand available for investment is EUR 61M atthe end of March 2019, which is expected to be fully utilized and therebyincreasing asset utilization from 67% and improving the financial performance.Third party review confirming DDM’s future ERCDDM engaged one of the Big 4 accountancy firms with extensive experience andknowledge in the Non-Performing Loan industry in Southern, Central and EasternEurope to conduct an independent review of DDM’s ERC from its secured andunsecured portfolios during the first quarter. The review of the ERC has been akey focus area for me since taking on the role as CEO of DDM. I am very pleasedwith the outcome of the review, conducted by a well renowned company whichconfirms the future estimated cashflows.Strategic shift towards secured portfoliosOur business model is flexible and opportunistic, and we believe that there willbe continued profitable business opportunities that can be capitalized toachieve greater value both in the process of investing and managing NPLportfolios. During the quarter we also launched a partnership with the company720 Restructuring & Advisory, where the majority of the ownership is beingcontrolled by DDM. The partnership will provide portfolio management servicesand oversee the debt collection process for secured portfolios in the Balkans.This will complement the existing network of outsourced debt collection agenciesand enable us to be closer to the market, ensuring increased control andmanagement of larger, more complex work outs of corporate secured receivables.Market outlookWe aim to deliver sizeable and profitable growth in 2019 as we continue to focuson our core markets across Southern, Central and Eastern Europe where we havestrong market knowledge and relationships.As part of the outlook we expect projected ERC to increase by about EUR 100M inlight of committed investments including the acquisition of a significantportfolio containing secured corporate receivables in Croatia. The most activemarkets for us are currently the Balkans and Greece. We expect economicexpansion, improving labour market conditions and increased lending activity topresent further investment opportunities.

This, combinedwith the fact that our customer base is growing in a sound and sustainable way,has given us a good start to 2019. We are maintaining a high pace of expansionand innovation at the same time as we are focusing on cost efficiency andscalability in the Group. This makes us well positioned for a year of continuedprofitable growth.First quarter resultsRevenue during the first quarter amounted to EUR 86.3 m (77.4), an increase of12%. Organic growth in local currencies was 4%. Growth during the first quartercontinued to be affected by the regulatory tightening that took place in the UKlast year. Excluding the UK, organic growth for the Group was 19%, whichreflects stable underlying growth in general for the Group. In March we postedthe highest revenue and in February the lowest revenue for the period.EBITDA totalled EUR 7.2 m (9.5), corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 8.3%(12.3%). Our marketing investments remained at a high level during the firstquarter, among other reasons to secure our leading position in Sweden. RoyalPanda increased its pace of investment following a very low level of marketingduring the preceding quarter. We paid EUR 11.5 m in gaming duties during thefirst quarter, which is an increase of EUR 4.3 m compared with the precedingquarter, which affected the operating margin for the period.We are seeing positive effects from our highlighted focus on efficiency and costcontrol within the Group. We continue to work on renegotiating supplieragreements in gaming, payments and marketing, among other areas, where we arebenefiting from our size and position as one of Europe’s leading casinooperators. At the same time, we are continuously reviewing our internaloperating costs and processes. The effects of this work are expected to beginshowing gradually in 2019 in the form of increased scalability on a growingrevenue base.SwedenSweden has now been regulated for a quarter. We are generally satisfied with ourperformance during the period, where we had record-high customer activity andbelieve to have taken market shares. Our organic revenue decreased by 16% duringthe first quarter, adjusted for currency movements, partly owing to short-termeffects of the market’s regulation in January. At the same time our depositingcustomer base grew 23% compared with the same period a year ago. Revenue inSweden during the quarter has been growing month on month, and this trend hascontinued into the second quarter.The new regulation in Sweden entailed a number of changes for our customers andfor the industry, resulting in short- as well as long-term effects. I’mreferring in particular to changes in the customer experience, competition,gaming duties, and new marketing channels and payment solutions. As is alwaysthe case when a market becomes regulated, it will take some time for theindustry and customers to adapt, and thereafter we expect a more stable andpredictable market.Regulation has sparked an intensive debate on the amount of marketing. We alsoagree that the volume right now is too high, which at the same time is naturalin a recently regulated market in which new players, such as the state-runcompanies, are launching new products. Therefor we are working to diversify ourmarketing mix to other channels than commercial radio and TV, and we areconveying the responsible gaming message more in our advertising.Over time, a regulated market tends to lead to fewer operators. We have alreadybegun to see this trend, as smaller operators are now leaving or reducing theirfocus in Sweden. This means that the amount of marketing is gradually expectedto decrease.What makes it difficult for the industry to self-regulate is when the governmenturges operators to apply for licences only to shortly after consider majorchanges in the terms as soon as the licence system is in place. In this case itapplies to marketing. We are now awaiting the findings of a study into howmarketing is to be handled. The study is expected to be ready by October 2020,and we are looking forward to clearer guidelines. One should keep in mind thatit is in the state’s interest to protect the licence system and itschannelisation. The greatest benefit for licensed operators, who pay local taxesand adhere to local rules, is the ability to market themselves. A restriction ofmarketing opportunities would make it challenging to protect the channelisation.UKThe UK market remains challenging in the near term, but we are gradually makingprogress, and our customer acquisition is growing at Group level compared withthe preceding quarter. In particular, the brands we have gathered under Rocket Xare showing clear improvements, with sequential revenue growth paired with goodprofitability. Royal Panda, on the other hand, had a weaker quarter in the UK,partly coupled to the lower level of marketing in earlier quarters as well asnecessary regulatory adaptations in line with the rest of the Group.Our acquisitions in the UK have generally resulted in greater complexity coupledto synchronisation of databases, routines and processes between the differentGroup brands. To manage this in the best way and comply with the regulatoryrequirements, LeoVegas has an action plan that was initiated last year. LeoVegastakes compliance with the utmost seriousness and is working consistently toensure a safe experience for our customers in all markets, all to uphold ourposition as a credible, long-term and reliable operator.Scale-up marketsOne market that stuck out during the first quarter is Germany, where we expectto be granted extended gaming licences in Schleswig-Holstein, which gives us acompetitive advantage. Finland, Denmark and Canada also delivered good quarters,and in Italy we are taking market shares.LeoVenturesLeoVentures’ portfolio companies developed well during the period. The companiesare in various phases of rapid growth and investment, but despite this, togetherthey succeeded in making a positive contribution to EBITDA for the Group duringthe month of March. For the first time, the portfolio company Authentic Gamingalso achieved a positive result in March, and it is expected to continuegenerating profits. In line with previous communication, we are continuing withour strategic evaluation of LeoVentures.New brand on proprietary multibrand platformDuring the quarter we launched our proprietary multibrand platform. Owing to ourmultibrand functionality, we can now flexibly launch and scale up new brands.The first such brand that was launched is called GoGoCasino. The start andcustomer response have been positive and are proof of how we are successfullycapitalising on the Group’s strengths, experience and economies of scale. Duringthe year we expect to launch GoGoCasino in more markets.Comments on the second quarterThe month of April has developed well with preliminary revenue of EUR 30.5 m(29.1), representing a growth of 5%. Our current estimate is that marketingcosts in relation to revenue will decrease during the second quarter comparedwith the first quarter.LeoVegas has entered the second quarter with full focus on sustainable,profitable growth.Presentation of the report - today at 09:00 CET  · To participate in the conference call, and thereby be able to ask questions,please call one of the following numbers: SE: +46 (0) 8 5069 2180, UK: +44 (0)20 71 92 80 00, US: +1 63 15 10 74 95, Confirmation code: 2488668 or join at theweb https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/kfovvaakThis information is information that LeoVegas AB (publ) is obliged to makepublic pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014.

Sportamore AB,2019-04-30 08:00:00,"Growth in total sales and stable gross margin developmentIn a quarter with stagnating market growth and an industry characterized by highcampaign intensity Sportamore shows a sales growth of 13.3 per cent and thetotal sales*  totalled SEK 237.7 (209.9) million. We want more, and althoughthis growth rate is just below our recently updated financial goals we do notbelieve that it affects our ability to deliver on our growth goals on an annualbasis. Customer orders grew by 22 per cent during the period while the averageorder value fell by 7.1 per cent compared to the first quarter last year. Thechange in average order value is primarily explained by a deferred flow ofreturns and an earlier seasonal shift than last year.The gross margin reflects a strong improvement compared to the prior quarter andnow totals 36.5 per cent – in line with same quarter last year. We want more inthis regard too and the development strengthens the picture of our ability tocontrol gross margin even under more challenging market conditions. The positivemargin trend has also been evident at the beginning of the second quarter and weexpect continued improved gross margin in the second quarter compared to theprevious year.Customer growthThe customer base continues to grow according to plan and we are seeing acontinued annual growth acceleration in the annual growth of the customer basewhich now totals 1,011,000 active customers. We are also seeing a continued,positive trend in the number of orders per active customer which provides ordergrowth leverage over time. The proportion of customers who returned within 90days of the previous transaction was over 40 per cent during the period, despitea strong influx of new customers. Customer acquisition cost in terms of absolutenumbers and lifetime value remain stable over time, while marketing expenses asa proportion of operating income increased during the period. The latter is adirect result of a lower average order value but based on a stable lifetimevalue per customer we have actively continued to invest in new customeracquisition.Unrealized economies of scale affect earnings in the quarterSportamore has over the past two years invested in infrastructure and automationfor scalability and efficiency. The benefits of this strategy when turnoverrises were evident in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Group’s operatingexpenses, excluding cost of goods, have a smaller linear correlation with salesthan before, which is of course favorable during growth, but with a lowerturnover during the period, this has had a negative effect on the EBIT marginwhich amounted to SEK -9.8 (1.3) million for the quarter. We maintain that 2019on a full-year basis is expected to generate improved earnings compared to 2018,at the same time as the customer base's strong growth increases the futurepotential. We are confident that continued efficiency gains will contribute tofurther improvement of the cost structure for the coming quarters.[image]Updated financial goalsSportamore will continue its strong growth journey. In our financial goals, westate that we will deliver sales growth of 15-25 per cent annually. We also seethat the investments made in infrastructure and automation has given us afantastic position to enjoy great economies of scale together with futuregrowth.This is one of the reasons that have strengthen our belief in the Group’sability and caused Sportamore’s financial goal to be updated. We are moving awayfrom our previous, EBITDA-based goal which is replaced with a goal of an EBITmargin of at least 5 per cent for all markets. The transition to EBIT fromprevious EBITDA is also related to the fact that our investments in inventoryautomation have significantly increased our depreciations and thus we considerEBIT to be a more relevant measure in this context.Expansion to FrancePreparations for the expansion to France are continuing according to plan, andwe now expect to be up and running in the third quarter 2019. Our focus onautomation and scalable processes has simplified the work and lays goodfoundation for potential to continue to scale up our total addressablegeographical market.Sound finances and healthy inventory levelThe Group’s financial position remains healthy, with cash in hand totalling SEK51 million, excluding an overdraft facility of SEK 40 million. The inventoryvalue at the end of the period totalled SEK 308 (238) million. The inventoryremains healthy, with less than 16 per cent being more than six months old. Atthe same time, we see a higher volume of winter goods in stock than last year,and this will be held in inventory until the autumn, when we believe that it canonce more be sold at the planned margin. We are currently well-stocked withseasonal goods – ready to meet the spring and summer of 2019 with acceleratinggrowth. We are maintaining our ambition to increase stock turnover during theyear.* Own sales plus the total value of products sold from commission-basedrevenues, where own sales refers to operating income less provision fromcommissionbased sales.This information is information that Sportamore AB (publ) is obligated todisclose pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Swedish SecuritiesMarket Act.

Revenues increased by 19% toSEK 9,785 million with an organic growth of 14%. Our operating profit increasedby 27% to SEK 1,930 million.The operating margin was 19.7% and excluding changein provision for LTI programs the operating margin was 20.3%. More favorableexchange rates had a positive effect on the margin.Our service business continues to grow healthily. This has a positive impact onour overall profit and will contribute to our resilience going forward.Equipment revenues increased versus last year, but fell sequentially compared tothe very strong Q4, which had a negative effect on our cost efficiency in thequarter. In the Tools & Attachments segment, we are pleased to see that ourefficiency actions had a positive effect on the operating profit and margin.Working capital increased in the quarter, and continues to be a focus area forimprovement. The operating cash flow was lower than in the previous quarter as aresult.Demand expected to remain at a good levelThe customer demand in the first quarter 2019 was largely in line with ourexpectations, with equipment orders at similar levels as in the second half of2018. Orders received were SEK 10,063 million, somewhat higher compared to Q42018 but an organic decline of 5% compared to a strong Q1 2018. The majority ofmining equipment orders are still for expansion in or close to existing minesrather than for replacement. The aftermarket business remained strong,reflecting the solid activity in the market, both in mining and ininfrastructure.While our customers continue to be active and relatively confident about thefuture, and the mineral prices are at healthy levels, there are stilluncertainties related to the economic development. We see that our customersprimarily invest in lower risk projects with focus on increased productivity andefficiency. We do not see any clear indications that the current marketsituation will change and expect that the demand will remain at the currentlevel in the near term.Business development and efficiency actionsWe have completed the earlier announced acquisitions of Fordia and New ConceptMining. This strengthens our position in exploration and rock reinforcement andadds some SEK 1.2 billion in annual revenues. At the same time, we are carryingout a number of efficiency actions. Our supply-chain program is progressingaccording to plan, and changes are being rolled out in selected geographies.Short term, the program has some negative effects on inventory and costefficiency, but it is necessary to improve long-term efficiency. In Tools &Attachments, we have also pruned the product portfolio and we see some positiveeffects of our efficiency actions.Innovations, automation, digitalization and battery powerWe are pleased to see that we received several inquiries and orders forautomation and battery solutions. We received a large order for undergroundbattery equipment from Canada and orders were booked for Mobilaris MiningIntelligence, a decision support solution for mine efficiency and safety. Wewere present at the Bauma exhibition in early April and presented a number ofinnovations, including My Epiroc, a digital tool to help our customers to becomemore efficient in managing their fleet, and the new generation SmartROC D65, anautomation ready surface drill rig.Looking aheadIn 2018 we put a lot of effort into the split and listing of Epiroc. In 2019 wewill focus on improving and developing the business further.

increase business momentumand each business area has identified a number of initiatives to drive clientvalue and revenue growth. Examples include investments in Private Banking inNorway and Sweden, the acquisition of Gjensidige Bank, new distribution channelswithin Asset Management and Wholesale Banking and actions to regain momentum onmortgages, where we are already starting to see results.The key drivers behind the structural cost efficiency are increased usage ofautomation and robotics, the ongoing ramp-up in Poland and Estonia andoutsourcing of Group Technology mainframe to IBM. We are also simplifying byharmonising products and services and leveraging scale by further consolidatingcommon units, for instance global operations and services.CostFor 2021, we expect the cost base in constant currencies to be approximately 3%below the 2018 cost base excluding items affecting comparability in 2018[1] andcash costs are expected to be down by up to 10% in constant currencies over thesame period.Costs for 2019 are expected to be lower in constant currencies compared to 2018excluding items affecting comparability in 2018 and 2019[2] and the total cashcost is expected to be lower in constant currencies over the same period.[1] Goodwill write-down of EUR 141m in Q4 2018[2] Adjusted for the goodwill write-down of EUR 141m in 2018, transaction costsof EUR 90m in 2019, higher resolution fee in 2019 and provision of EUR 95m in Q12019Credit qualityOur expectation for the coming quarters is that net losses will remain low andaround the average level for 2018.Capital policyGiven the implementation of transitional arrangements agreed with the ECBfollowing Nordea’s transfer to the Banking Union and with the aim to maintainthe same nominal management buffer, the management buffer has been adjusted froma range of 50–150 bps to 40–120 bps. This is mainly a technical adjustment andhence the management buffer remains largely unchanged in nominal EUR amounts.The current level of the management buffer is approximately EUR 2.2bn (130 bps).Nordea aims to achieve a yearly increase in the dividend per share, whilemaintaining a strong capital position in line with the capital policy.The entire report can be found on the below link on our website.Nordea Group Q1 2019 Report (https://www.nordea.com/en/investor-relations/reports-and-presentations/latest-interim-results/)For further information:Casper von        Christopher Rees, Group CFO,Koskull,          +45 5547 2377President andGroup CEO,+358 503 821391Rodney Alfvén,    Sara Helweg-Larsen, Head ofHead of           Group Communications, +45 2214Investor          0000Relations, +4672 235 05 15Latest interimresults (https://www.nordea.com/en/investor-relations/reports-and-presentations/latest-interim-results/%20)The information provided in this stock exchange release was submitted forpublication through the agency of the contact persons set out above at 07:30 EET(06:30 CET) on 30 April 2019.We build strong and close relationships through our engagement with customersand society.

Lime Technologies AB,2019-04-29 15:05:00,"Best quarter ever  · Net sales amounted to MSEK 69.9 (58.5), rendering a net sales growth of 19%(18%). Organic net sales growth was 19% (14%)  · Recurring revenue amounted to MSEK 39.1 (32.1)  · The quarter was charged with items affecting comparability of MSEK 0.3 (0)attributable to the company's listing on Nasdaq Stockholm  · Adjusted EBITA amounted to MSEK 13.8 (11.6) which corresponds to an adjustedEBITA margin of 19.8% (19.8%)  · Net income amounted to MSEK 7.5 (6.7)  · Earnings per share, before dilution, amounted to SEK 0.56 (0.54) and dilutedto SEK 0.56 (0.50)CEO’s comment:We are proud of the strong growth and solid results we have achieved during thefirst quarter. Having said that, we are also aware that as a growth company wemust perform at ourall-time-best, almost every quarter. Growth is what enablesus to progress rapidly with product development, what intensifies ourcompetitiveness and retains our team members.Net sales in the first quarter amounted to MSEK 69.9, corresponding to anorganic growth of 19% compared to the same quarter last year. Recurring revenue,which is an important growth driver, increased by 22% during the first quartercompared to the same quarter last year.Being a growth company within the IT industry is, and should be, a challenge.This is a result of constant changes in the external environment, boldcompetitors and an exceptionally tough contest for skilled personnel. Regardlessof the challenges, and the hardship that comes with growth, the alternative isfar worse. Settling and becoming complacent is a recipe for stagnation. At Limewe are always proud of what we have achieved, but never complacent. We mustalways strive to move forward and make progress, both as a company and asindividuals.An important driving force in our organic growth is new sales and taking marketshares away from our competitors. In the first quarter, we have signed severalmajor deals, not least within our focus verticals in Finland and Norway. We haveproudly welcomed Bolig-byggelaget Tobb AS and AS Pellerin as new real estatecustomers, Elenia Oy and Trönder-energi AS as new utility customers, and OyFlikenberg, Oy Snellman, Wulff Oy and Forlags-huset Vigmostad & Björke AS as newwholesales customers.Recruitment is another critical driving force for our organic growth. In myfourth quarter comments, I mentioned how we had been successful in recruitingmore new employees relatively early in our recruitment process. Initially thisleads to increased costs, but in the long-term it has positive effects on bothgrowth and profitability. During the first quarter 2019, we achieved an adjustedEBITA of MSEK 13.8, corresponding to an EBITA margin of 20%, which isparticularly pleasing considering the higher than expected costs for person-nel.Even though we have had success in recruiting more employees than expected inthe fourth quarter 2018, we are maintaining our strong recruitment focus inorder to underpin the growth ambition. We will continue to expand our traineeprogram and achieve a number of recruitments before the trainees start theirtraining period in early August.To support our organic growth, we are constantly looking for smalleracquisitions to strengthen our product portfolio. In this respect, we have had anumber of interesting discussions in the first quarter. It remains to be seen ifthese discussions will result in more wisdom, cooperation or in fact in businessacquisitions.As mentioned, we are very proud of the strong growth and solid profitability inthe first quarter, but we are not completely satisfied. We are committed tocontinuing our efforts to progress and advance. Our focus is on maintaining long-term profitable growth.Erik Syrén, CEO of Lime Technologies AB (publ)Read the entire report in the attached PDF.Invitation to webcast for the presentation of Lime Technologies’ Interim Reportfor January-March 2019On Monday, April 29, at 15.30 CET, are analysts, investors, media and otherinterested parties invited to attend a webcast where Lime’s CEO, Erik Syrén, andCFO, Magnus Hansson, will comment on the published report and answer questions.The presentation will be held in English.The presentation material will be available on Lime’s website.The link to the webcast can be foundhere (https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/8392054783223340301).For more information, contact:Lime Technologies AB (publ)Erik Syrén, CEO / +46 707-38 50 72 / erik.syren@lime.techMagnus Hansson, CFO / +46 708-55 55 40 / magnus.hansson@lime.techJohan Holmqvist, Head of Investor Relations /+46 708-37 66 77 /johan.holmqvist@lime.techThis information constituted inside information prior to publication.

During the first quarter, the orderintake grew by 22 per cent and invoiced sales by 24 per cent. Excludingacquisitions and foreign exchange effects, the order intake grew by 11 per centand invoiced sales by 12 per cent. At the end of the quarter, the order backlogstood at a new record level of SEK 2,186 m (1,338 m) and was thus up animpressive 63 per cent on the previous year's value. This excellent performanceand good cost control in our companies have resulted in a profit of SEK 411 m(278 m) in the quarter with an operating margin of 13.1 per cent (11.0). Ourbest quarter ever, in absolute terms, and a very positive start to 2019.In line with our long-term strategy, we are continuing to invest broadly in ourbusiness areas in product development, sales and marketing. Activity hasgenerally remained high for our business areas in most of the markets in whichthey operate. This must surely be confirmation that our operations are offeringwhat the market wants. The companies are providing high-quality products andservices and delivering good standards of service and support. The fact that wehave a global presence with operations in many countries means that we are notas vulnerable to local economic fluctuations.We made one acquisition for the industrial operations in the first quarter.Aritco Group, within the Latour Industries business area, acquired the Norwegiancompany TKS Heis AS. Read more about our acquisitions on page4.The development of the stock market has again been positive after the downturnat the end of last year. Our investment portfolio increased by as much as 20.7per cent, adjusted for changes in the portfolio, while the benchmark index SIXRXincreased by 13.2 per cent. The net asset value in Latour increased by 18.9 percent to SEK 119 per share in the same period. In March, we accepted an offer andsold all of the remaining shares in Loomis, which was a natural consequence ofour first disposal back in 2016.Only a few of our listed holdings have yet submitted reports. On the whole thesereports are good and stable, which again corroborates the high quality of thecompanies in our portfolio. The acquisition activities in the investmentportfolio have continued. Assa Abloy has announced a number of acquisitions,including the acquisition of the Swiss listed Agta Record. In addition,Fagerhult acquired iGuzzini in March. This acquisition makes Fagerhult one ofthe largest leading lighting companies in Europe, generating annual sales inexcess of SEK 8 billion.

We believe thatin the not too distant future, the vast majority of all cars sold will beequipped with advanced driving assistance technology. We also believe thatVeoneer, with our cutting-edge offering in a broad range of Active Safetyproducts, will be one of the leaders in this emerging industry. However, thespeed of this transition is proving more difficult to predict than earlieranticipated. We have to adjust our speed to changing road conditions.At present, we see changes in the market. The first quarter was weaker thanexpected. Light vehicle production during the first quarter deteriorated beyondmarket expectations. In addition, Veoneer sales declined more than the lightvehicle production primarily driven by our high-level content on premium carmodels in current deliveries. This vehicle segment saw a sharper productiondecline than the general market.We currently see these trends continuing through 2019, primarily due to weakmarkets in China and Europe. We still expect the second half, mainly the fourthquarter, to be stronger than the first half of 2019. We now anticipate ourorganic sales will decline for the full year 2019 as compared to 2018. Weexperienced continued increasing RD&E costs during the quarter. This w as mainlydriven by the complexity of certain projects, change requests from our customersand high level of new hires.At the same time, our order intake continues to be strong. Our strategicallyimportant Active Safety business specifically show ed progress. While launchschedules into 2020 are mainly on track, we see some potential customer launchdelays and lower production volumes than previously expected.Developing cutting-edge technology for the next generation of automotivemobility requires resources, particularly in a situation when the order intakecontinues to be strong. In consideration of this and the changed marketconditions, the company has decided to seek additional funding to help securethe continued development of our product portfolio.Moving forward, w e w ill continue our focus on growth and take firm internalactions to adjust to the market changes by:  · increasing our efforts on the initiatives around investment priorities, asannounced in the fourth quarter 2018 earnings report,  · improving balance sheet and cash-flow efficiency, including restrictions oncapital expenditures and focus on operating working capital,  · undertaking several gross margin improvement initiatives,  · maintaining RD&E costs relatively flat at a maximum of $600 million for thefull year 2019,  · enhancing efficiency and focus on w inning orders within the productportfolio,  · reviewing our brake control business, a process that is w ell under w ay,and  · reviewing the focus of Zenuity, as the market opportunities move toCollaborative Driving and self-driving is pushed out in time.Our belief is firm: The future belongs to Collaborative Driving. By CreatingTrust in Mobility we believe we are w ell on our w ay to realizing the vision.Veoneer is built on close to 70 years of developing safety systems withinAutoliv, a pioneer in automotive safety. A vital part of our heritage is ourability to patiently build profitable business models based on innovation.As described above, we see deteriorating business conditions in the near term,including lower than expected light vehicle production. We also do not expect tosee the effects of our efficiency and prioritization initiatives until thelatter part of the year and into 2020. This situation, along with our capitalneeds for RD&E due to continued strong order intake, execution of currentcustomer projects and the continued development of our product portfolio, hasled the Company to consider alternatives for approaching the capital markets fora capital raise of up to $500 million.We are fully committed to address the short-term challenges head on. We have astrong and dedicated management team, cutting edge technology, a talented workforce, and a competitive product portfolio with an order book of more than $19billion points toward a strengthened future market position.

Hansa Biopharma AB,2019-04-29 08:00:00,"MAA filing of IDEFIRIX (imlifidase) in Europe marks a milestone in Hansa’sevolution into a commercial stage biopharmaceutical companyJanuary – March 2019 Highlights  · The European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted Hansa’s Marketing AuthorizationApplication (MAA) for review of IDEFIRIX (imlifidase). This acceptance marks thebeginning of the regulatory review process for IDEFIRIX in the European Union(EU). IDEFIRIX has both EU Orphan Drug Designation and PRIority MEdicine (PRIME)designation. An opinion of the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for HumanUse (CHMP) is expected within 210 days plus potential clock stops for applicantresponses.  · In Hansa’s most recent meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA) in December 2018, the agency provided overall positive feedback on thedata generated on imlifidase to date and acknowledged the high unmet medicalneed of highly sensitized patients who currently can’t access kidneytransplantation. Hansa has now decided to do complementary analyses with respectto transplantability for highly sensitized patients, based on data from thesuccessfully completed Phase 2 studies of imlifidase and matched controls fromthe U.S. transplant registry (SRTR/OPTN). We believe these analyses will helpfurther illustrate the value of imlifidase in the U.S. healthcare system. Assoon as the analyses are concluded, Hansa will schedule a subsequent meetingwith the FDA, expected to take place in the second half of 2019. In thismeeting, the dialogue with the FDA will be continued to determine the pathforward for regulatory filing and approval in the U.S. for imlifidase in kidneytransplantation of highly sensitized patients.  · The Company has selected a lead candidate from its NiceR program (Novel IgGCleaving Enzymes for Repeat dosing). The new drug candidate may have broadervalue as a potential treatment for unmet needs that would benefit from repeatdosing, including relapsing autoimmune diseases, chronic transplant rejection,oncology and gene therapy. This is the first IgG eliminating enzyme from theNiceR program that Hansa intends to advance into clinical development.  · The Company’s Phase 2 study of imlifidase in acute Antibody-MediatedRejection (AMR) in Kidney Transplantation has received Clinical TrialApplication and Ethics Committee approvals. The study will enroll approximately30 patients at eight clinical trial centers in France, Sweden, Austria,Australia and the United States.  · The Company has continued to expand its leadership team as Hansa transformsinto commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company. Donato Spota has been appointedthe Company’s new Chief Financial Officer, effective May 15, 2019 and AnneSäfström Lanner has been appointed Vice President, Global Human Resources. Mr.Spota is a senior executive with more than 20 years of strategic and operationalexperience in the global pharmaceutical industry, including investor relationsand international capital markets transactions. Mrs. Lanner has over 15 years ofbroad human resources experience in international growth companies.Significant events after the end of the reporting period  · Hansa Biopharma received Clinical Trial Application and Ethics Committeeapprovals in Europe for its Phase 2 study of imlifidase in Guillain BarréSyndrome (GBS). The study will enroll up to 30 patients at approximately tenclinical trial centers in France, U.K and the Netherlands over the next 18months.  · Hansa Biopharma divested its entire equity holding in Genovis AB (NASDAQStockholm: GENO). The transaction generated gross proceeds of SEK 89 million($9.6 million). The proceeds will be used as working capital not only toexpedite further the clinical development program of imlifidase in transplantrejection (AMR) and autoimmune diseases, but also to ramp up preparations forclinical studies with the recently selected lead in the NiceR-program, Hansa’sprogram for the development of novel IgG-cleaving enzymes for repeat dosing.Financial summary for the first quarterKSEK, unless otherwise stated   Q1 2019   Q1 2018   Year 2018Net revenue                         917       588       3,358Operating profit/loss           -72,682   -46,622    -246,498Net profit/loss                 -72,479   -46,498    -247,974Earnings per share before and     -1.81     -1.23       -6.47after dilution (SEK)Shareholders’                   835,074   591,805     859,876equityCash flow from operating       -101,602   -44,094    -204,560activitiesCash and cash equivalents       759,230   575,049     858,187including short terminvestmentsCEO statementIt is now twelve months since I joined Hansa, and I’m extremely proud of all weaccomplished this past year to demonstrate the potential of our immunomodulatoryenzyme technology and imlifidase. Our main priority is getting our lead compoundimlifidase to market to enable lifesaving kidney transplants for highlysensitized patients, who currently cannot receive this standard of caretreatment. At the same time, we continue developing our proprietary enzymologyplatform in other rare, life-threatening diseases.In February, EMA accepted our MAA for review of IDEFIRIX (imlifidase). Thisacceptance marks the beginning of the regulatory review process for IDEFIRIX inthe EU. In our most recent meeting the FDA in December 2018, the agency providedoverall positive feedback on the data generated on imlifidase to date andacknowledged the high unmet medical need of highly sensitized patients whocurrently can’t access kidney transplantation. Hansa has now decided to docomplementary analyses with respect to transplantability for highly sensitizedpatients, based on data from the successfully completed Phase 2 studies ofimlifidase and matched controls from the U.S. transplant registry (SRTR/OPTN).We believe these analyses will help further illustrate the value of imlifidasein the U.S. healthcare system. As soon as the analyses are concluded, Hansa willschedule a subsequent meeting with the FDA, expected to take place in the secondhalf of 2019. In this meeting, the dialogue with the FDA will be continued todetermine the path forward for regulatory filing and approval in the U.S. forimlifidase in kidney transplantation of highly sensitized patients.Imlifidase may have potential applications in transplantation of other organsand tissue as well as an array of acute autoimmune indications, including AcuteKidney Antibody Mediated Rejection (AMR) post transplantation. In March, wereceived Clinical Trial Application and Ethics Committee approvals for our Phase2 study of imlifidase in acute AMR in kidney transplantation. Acute AMR is oneof the most challenging adverse events after kidney transplantation, occurringin 10-15% of patients, and is the main cause for graft dysfunction. In April wegot a similar approval for the initiation of a Phase 2 Study of imlifidase inGuillain Barré Syndrome (GBS). GBS is a rare, acute inflammatory disease of theperipheral nervous system that affects 1-2 in 100,000 people annually.Our program of next generation IgG-cleaving enzymes, NiceR, also advancedrecently with the selection of a lead candidate for clinical development. Thenew drug candidate may have broader value as a potential treatment for unmetneeds that may benefit from repeat dosing, including relapsing autoimmunediseases, chronic transplant rejection, oncology and gene therapy.Mid-April we divested our shareholding in Genovis to a group of Swedishinstitutional investors. The transaction provides a profitable exit for HansaBiopharma, and the funds generated will be used as working capital to furtherexpedite our promising clinical pipeline of potential treatments for rare IgG-mediated diseases.As part of the ongoing expansion of our organization, we appointed Mr. DonatoSpota as new Chief Financial Officer, effective May 15, 2019, and Ms. AnneSäfström Lanner as Vice President, Global Human Resources. We are delighted towelcome Donato and Anne as we grow Hansa Biopharma into a global commercial-stage biopharma company. They will be very valuable additions to our team as wecontinue the transformation of Hansa and grow our operations and organization.Based on the progress so far this year, I believe we are poised for continuedsuccess in 2019, with a growing body of clinical evidence supporting theefficacy of imlifidase, multiple opportunities in additional indications, and apotential pipeline of next-generation drug candidates.

Trelleborg AB,2019-04-26 13:00:00,"""A decent start to the year""“Trelleborg started the year with the highest EBIT to date for a single quarter.Despite that, we are not satisfied with our performance, as our operating margindeclined during the period. Some of our operations were burdened by sales mixand certain units lagged behind in compensating for increased costs. However, itis important to note that both the economy as a whole and our own businessactivity remain at a generally high level. Order bookings continued to trendpositively during the quarter, although certain market segments are displaying amore modest organic trend year on year.Sales increased 9 percent, of which organic sales contributed 1 percentage pointand structural growth 2 percentage points. During the quarter, the Group’sorganic growth slowed compared with the preceding period, in particular, therewas a reduction in business from automotive-related customers.Operating cash flow was mainly impacted by a higher rate of investment andhigher seasonal working capital compared with the preceding year. We assess thatcash flow will normalize moving forward.Our largest business area, Trelleborg Sealing Solutions, registered unchangedorganic sales, but with distinct differences between the various segments. Salesto aerospace were strong, at the same time as there was a downturn in sales tothe automotive industry. Sales to general industry were more stable, albeit withsome geographic differences. Within the business area, we continue to addresources to enable long-term growth in several segments.Organic sales for our tire operation performed favorably, but earnings werenegatively impacted by the sales mix and some imbalance between raw materialsand sales prices during the quarter.Trelleborg Industrial Solutions continues to display a favorable growth rate,and most market segments developed in a positive direction. As earlier forecast,profitability was still impacted by inefficiency in a Czech production unit.Intensive efforts are under way to improve the situation.The delivery situation in the offshore oil & gas operation remained difficultduring the quarter, but at the same time, we are seeing both market activity andorder bookings continuing to increase. The business area is expected to improveits earnings during the quarters ahead, and our forecast of positive earnings inthe latter part of the year stands firm.A few acquisitions were also completed during the quarter and I particularlywant to highlight Sil-Pro, which complements and broadens Trelleborg’s existingofferings in healthcare & medical. Through a number of acquisitions, we havebuilt a competitive platform in this market segment and we have now achieved acritical mass, in which global organic initiatives will increase further inscope moving forward.In addition to acquisitions, the investments in our operations continued at anhistorically high level, which is aimed at strengthening our leading marketpositions and creating an improved platform for future growth. One example ofthis is that, during April, we opened a new state-of-the-art production facilityin Ohio, in the U.S., where the operations of three facilities were consolidatedinto a shared, efficient unit. We are also continuing to position ourselvesgeographically, with an example of this being the establishment of anotherfacility in India during the quarter.During the period, we extended our syndicated credit facility, which constitutesthe majority of our long-term funding, and we are thus well-financed oncompetitive terms for the foreseeable future.Although our business environment is dominated by extensive uncertainty, ouroverall assessment is that the demand for our products and solutions will movelaterally next quarter. We monitor developments continuously and stand preparedto manage our various operations according to varied levels of demand,” saysPeter Nilsson, President and CEO.First quarterNet sales for the first quarter of 2019 rose 9 percent to SEK 9,381 M (8,577).Organic sales increased 1 percent, both for the Group in its entirety andexcluding project deliveries.EBIT, excluding items affecting comparability, amounted to SEK 1,295 M (1,291),which was equivalent to an EBIT margin of 13.8 percent (15.1). EBIT was thehighest to date in a single quarter for the Group.Items affecting comparability for the quarter were a negative SEK 20 M (neg: 18)and pertained to restructuring costs in line with earlier communications.Earnings per share, excluding items affecting comparability, totaled SEK 3.25(3.41). For the Group in its entirety, earnings per share amounted to SEK 3.14(3.36).Operating cash flow amounted to SEK 179 M (408). The cash conversion ratio forthe most recent 12-month period declined to 70 percent (12 months 2018: 74),impacted by a higher level of capital expenditure and somewhat higher workingcapital.Market outlook for the second quarter 2019Demand is expected to be on a par with the first quarter of 2019, adjusted forseasonal variations.Market outlook from the interim report published on February 13, 2019, relatingto the first quarter of 2019Demand is expected to be on a par with, or somewhat lower than, the fourthquarter of 2018, adjusted for seasonal variations.For further information, please contact:Media: Vice President Media Relations Karin Larsson, +46 (0)410 67015, +46(0)733 747015, karin.larsson@trelleborg.comInvestors/analysts: Vice President IR Christofer Sjögren, +46 (0)410 67068, +46(0)708 665140, christofer.sjogren@trelleborg.comThis information is information that Trelleborg AB is obliged to make publicpursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Securities Markets Act.

The sharp decline in LVP was more than offset bycontinued growth from new launches and we were able to grow sales organically*by almost 2%. However, profitability was negatively affected by the mix impactof LVP driven sales decline for established business and sales growth comingfrom new launches, as profitability on new launches is initially lower untilproduction is fully ramped up to the designed line capacity.We saw a clear improvement in launch related costs compared to the fourthquarter of 2018, although we still expect it will take a few more quarters to beback at a normal launch cost level.Our order intake share remained at a good level although OEM order activity wasrelatively modest in the quarter.I am pleased that the labor conflict in Mexico is closed, with only limitedproduction back-log effects remaining, although we are of course never satisfiedwhen disturbances brings negative impacts on us and our customers.With the EC antitrust decision behind us, we continue to focus on launcheffectiveness, productivity and managing light vehicle production volatility,while, as always, having quality as our first priority.Inquiries: Investors and AnalystsAnders TrappVice President Investor RelationsTel +46 (0)8 58 72 06 71Henrik KaarDirector Investor RelationsTel +46 (0)8 58 72 06 14Inquiries: MediaStina ThormanVice President CommunicationsTel +46 (0)8 58 72 06 50This information is information that Autoliv, Inc. is obliged to make publicpursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

My task is to work together with all ouremployees in the Group to continue to consistently carry out our strategy,focusing on results, simplicity and decentralisation.Lifco’s overall target is to increase earnings every year though both organicgrowth and acquisitions. Net sales for the first quarter increased by 25.5 percent to SEK 3,357 (2,674) million, driven by organic growth, acquisitions andforeign exchange gains. The generally favourable economy was a strongcontributing factor to organic growth. It should also be pointed out thatcomparative figures were affected by negative organic growth in the firstquarter of 2018.EBITA* increased by 40.4 per cent to SEK 587 (418) million during the quarterand the EBITA margin* improved by 1.9 percentage points to 17.5 (15.6) per cent.The improvement in profitability was mainly due to organic growth andacquisitions. The comparison is also impacted by Easter falling in April thisyear and the Demolition & Tools business area reporting a negative profitabilitytrend in the first quarter of last year. Earnings per share increased by 24.5%till SEK 3.51 (2.82) in the first quarter of 2019.All three business areas reported robust sales and earnings growth, andperformance was stable in all divisions. The market generally remained positivefor the three business areas during the quarter.Cash flow increased by 355 per cent to SEK 141 (31) million. Although cash flowimproved compared with the year-earlier quarter, we can note that the generallyfavourable market situation resulted in higher accounts receivable and inventorybuild-up in many of our businesses.During the period, Lifco strengthened Demolition & Tools with the addition oftwo new businesses with combined annual sales of around SEK 500 million. Thecompanies consolidated were Swedish company Indexator Rotator Systems, a world-leading manufacturer of rotators, and the majority of Italian company Hammer, aprovider of hydraulic hammers and other demolition tools for excavators. Theacquisitions jointly had a positive impact on Lifco’s results and financialposition during the quarter.We purchased the majority of UK company UK POS after the end of the quarter.

The business area also includes anumber of manufacturers which produce fitting products for dentures,disinfectants, saliva ejectors, bite registration and dental impressionmaterials, bonding agents and other consumables that are sold to dentiststhrough distributors around the world.

The lateEaster meant that March had more working days than in 2018. This means thatDental will experience a corresponding negative seasonal effect in the secondquarter of 2019.EBITA* increased by 21.5 per cent to SEK 232 (191) million in the period and theEBITA margin* improved by 1.7 percentage points to 20.6 (18.9) per cent, partlyas a result of the positive effect of Easter falling in April.The dental market remains generally stable.

At theend of the period, the number of employees was 5,219 (4,736). Acquisitions added240 employees.Events after the end of the reporting periodAfter the end of the period, the acquisition of the majority of UK company UKPOS (https://www.ukpos.com/) was consolidated in the Systems Solutions businessarea, Service and Distribution division (formerly Interiors for ServiceVehicles). The company is a leading supplier of exhibition and visual displaysolutions sold directly to end customers in various industries in the UK.  UKPOS had net sales of around GBP 12 million in 2018 and has just over 60employees.Related party transactionsNo significant transactions with related parties took place during the period.Risks and uncertaintiesThe risk factors which have the biggest impact for Lifco are the competitivesituation, structural changes in the market and general level of economicactivity. Lifco is also exposed to financial risks, including currency risks,interest rate risks, credit and counterparty risks.The Parent Company is affected by the above risks and uncertainties in itscapacity as owner of the subsidiary companies. For further information onLifco’s risks and risk management, see the 2018 Annual Report.Accounting policiesThe Group’s interim report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 InterimFinancial Reporting and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. In respect of theParent Company, the report has been prepared in accordance with the AnnualAccounts Act and Recommendation RFR 2 Financial Reporting for Legal Entities ofthe Swedish Financial Reporting Board. The accounting policies have been appliedin accordance with those which are presented in the 2018 Annual Report andshould be read in conjunction with these.The Group applies IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019, and the implementation of thestandard implies that nearly all leases are recognised in the balance sheet ofthe lessee, as there is no longer any distinction made between operating andfinance leases. According to IFRS 16, a tangible asset (the right to use aleased asset) and a financial liability (non-current and current) regarding theobligation to pay lease payments is to be recognised in the balance sheet. Inthe consolidated income statement, depreciation and interest expense arerecognised instead of operating leases, which were recognised in their entiretywithin operating profit. IFRS 16 will impact the cash flow insofar that leasingpayments impact the cash flow from operating activities (e.g. interest and low-value and short-term leases) and cash flow from financing activities (repaymentof the lease liability). The Group applies the modified retrospective approach,which entails that right-of-use assets are measured at an amount correspondingto the lease liability on 1 January 2019 (adjusted for prepaid and accrued leasepayments). Accordingly, the transition to IFRS 16 does not have any impact theGroup’s equity. Since the modified retrospective approach has been applied,comparative figures for 2018 have not been recalculated. The Group has chosen toapply the exception and thus not to recognise short-term leases and low-valueleases as a part of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability in thebalance sheet. Payments attributable to these leases has instead been recognisedas a cost straight line over the term of the lease. The remaining leasecommitments essentially comprise premises such as office, warehouse and factorypremises.Reconciliation of obligations foroperating leases and recognised leaseliability (SEK million)Obligations for operating leases 31     600December 2018Discounting effect                      -69Less: short-term leases and low-value   -67leases that are expensed straight-lineLess: corrections/reclassifications     -19Translation differences                 -5Lease liability recognised 1 January    4402019The weighted average marginal interest rate which has been used to calculate thediscounting effect is 2.09%.

Karo Pharma AB,2019-04-26 08:30:00,"  · Net sales amounted to MSEK 420.8 (267.1). This corresponds to an increase of58%. The growth is attributable to products acquired during the period.  · Net sales decreased by 6% compared to pro forma numbers for the same period2018. At comparable exchange rates, sales decreased by 8%. The decrease in netsales is mainly attributable to the Norwegian market, where a weak flu seasonand residual order situation affected the outcome.  · EBITDA amounted to MSEK 153.0 (88.7), corresponding to an EBITDA margin of36.4% (33.3%).  · The gross margin was 55.8% (56.8%).  · Cash flow from operating activities amounted to MSEK 91.8 (41.5).  · Earnings per share were SEK 0.25 (0.45).  · Cash and short-term investments amounted to MSEK 493.6 (295.2) at periodend.  · On January 2, 2019, Karo Intressenter announced that it raised theconsideration in its cash offer to SEK 38.00 for each share in Karo Pharma, thatthey extended the acceptance period until January 17, 2019, and that thecondition relating to obtaining the required regulatory and regulatory permits,approvals, decisions or similar had been fulfilled.

Christoffer assumes his new position on July 1, 2019. Until then, UlfMattsson has the role of acting CEO.COMMENT ON OPERATIONSDuring the first quarter of 2019, revenues continued to grow with 58 per cent.Pro-forma sales declined, partly due to a weak influenza season in Norway anddelivery problems at a manufacturer. The quarter was positively impacted by theacquired products from LEO Pharma. Integration of the product portfolio from LEOPharma is now in its final phase and we note that our key markets outside theNordic region are developing positively. Our main focus in 2019 will be tocontinue to develop and optimize the business and to launch the new products wehave in plan.Karo Pharma has grown sharply in recent years, mainly driven by strategicacquisitions. In a short time, the company has established itself as asuccessful Specialty Pharma company in the Nordic region and has now enteredEurope. In January 2019, EQT, through Karo Intressenter AB, acquired a majoritystake in Karo Pharma. EQT will be able to support the company with bothexpertise and capital, which will be critical for implementing the company’sstrategy going forward and achieving our long-term goals.An extraordinary general meeting in February decided to elect a new Board ofDirectors under Bo Jesper Hansen’s leadership. The new board has appointedChristoffer Lorenzen as the new CEO of Karo Pharma from July 1, 2019. Untilthen, I have been given the opportunity to assume the role of acting CEO. DuringApril, I familiarized myself with the business and worked intensively with themanagement to enable Karo Pharma’s continued growth journey and to helpChristoffer to a flying start.

Gunnebo AB,2019-04-26 08:01:00,"Q1 2019: Strong Order Intake for the GroupCEO CommentsPerformance for the QuarterGunnebo’s business is to a large extent project-driven where order intake andsales fluctuate between quarters. Therefore we will also disclose the orderintake per Business Unit as of Q1 2019.The first quarter of 2019 showed a strong order intake for the Group with year-on-year growth of 12% (7% in constant currencies). Entrance Control and SafeStorage reported double-digit growth of 27% and 16% respec-tively. CashManagement and Integrated Security reported a positive development on orderintake.Sales for the Group were up 4% compared to Q1 2018 (flat in constantcurrencies). In Safe Storage, sales grew by 16% year-on-year (10% in constantcurrencies). Cash Management sales had a slight increase of 2% (-3% in constantcurrencies) and sales in Entrance Control contracted by 4% year-on-year (-9% inconstant currencies) due to a large order delivered in Q1 last year. With thestrong order intake, sales will however recover in the coming quarters. We havegrown our sales two years in a row in both Cash Management and Entrance Controland we believe we are better structured today to capture growth in the market.In Integrated Security, sales contracted by 3% year-on-year (-4% in constantcurrencies) but with improved profitability.Strategy to focus the business by product offeringIn the quarter, Gunnebo has continued to implement the strategy aiming atsimplifying the Group’s structure and focus by product offering through the fourBusiness Units Safe Storage, Cash Management, Entrance Control and IntegratedSecurity. We started working in the new structure in Q2 2018, and I am pleasedto see an increase in customer interactions and clarifications of go-to-marketmodels gradually coming through in the different Business Units.As part of this strategy we are also investing in strengthening our brandpositioning in the market. In the quarter we launched an updated web presenceand successfully participated in four important exhibitions: EuroCIS in Germany,NRF in the US, Passenger Terminal Expo in the UK and Intersec in Dubai. InIntegrated Security we launched a new Electronic Article Surveillance technologywhich allows larger stores to operate up to 100 antennas without disturbancesand we continued the commercialisation of the retail digitisation solution,Gunnebo Retail Solutions.Results in the quarterThe Group’s overall EBITA margin was 3.9% which was lower than last year. Thelower margin is mainly explained by not yet seen improvements from ongoing costsaving activities and by underabsorption in Entrance Control and Cash Managementdue to the slow sales development in the quarter. In Integrated Security ourEBITA improved despite lower sales which is encouraging.In summary, we see increased activity in our overall customer interaction acrossBusiness Units, we are increasing our brand positioning activities and, whileundergoing the change into Business Units, we are also identifying areas ofefficiency improvements.

The operationalimprovements, specifically our focus on winter planning, led to an increasedoperative EBITA margin for the Group. While we continue to work with OperationalExcellence, we are still finalising a few challenging projects with high riskand low margins, which will continue until 2020.The Communication segment showed sales in line with last year and an operativeEBITA margin of 2.9% as increased utilisation rates and rightsizing had apositive effect in all main markets. We have experienced good operatingconditions and solid execution in Norway and Denmark, while the restructuring inSweden is proceeding according to plan and moving in the right direction.Sales in the Power segment was down, partly due to the expected downturn inSmart Grids and partly from Finland due to weather conditions and lower volumesin Build compared to last year. Lower gross margin and higher costs in Nordicand Polish High Voltage projects, in addition to the reduced sales, led to thenegative deviation in Power segment EBITA.Going forward we continue our Operational Excellence strategy with focus on thecustomer interface, flawless execution, production planning and efficiency inour operations.On 4 March 2019, we agreed with our banks on certain amendments to our existingfinancial agreement to better position ourselves for an evaluation of strategicalternatives for our Polish and German operations, including a potentialdivestment, which was announced on 3 April 2019. A divestment would mean thatEltel is taking the next step towards strengthening our position as the numberone Nordic player with lower risk and fewer capital-intensive projects, astronger financial position and reduced net debt.Operational Excellence, the amended bank agreement and a potential divestment ofthe Polish and German operations are key for Eltel to reach our long-term goal –an EBITA-margin of 5% with a stable cash flow and a healthy balance sheet.Casimir Lindholm, President & CEOFor further information, please contact:Petter Traaholt, CFOTel. +46 72 59 54 749, petter.traaholt@eltelnetworks.seElin Otter, Head of Communications and Investor RelationsTel. +46 72 59 54 692, elin.otter@eltelnetworks.seEltel AB discloses the information provided herein pursuant to the EU’s MarketAbuse Regulation and the Securities Markets Act.

It is great to see that most of our businessareas showed good organic growth. Sales growth amounted to 1.6%, driven byhigher prices and improved product mix. Underlying operating income was fairlyin line with last year. I am particularly pleased that our price execution fullyoffset the strong headwinds we faced from higher raw material costs, tradetariffs and currency.The earnings trend for our operations in Europe and Professional Productsremained solid. The business area Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa continuedto have strong growth in Southeast Asia, while in Australia sales declined. InNorth America and Latin America, cost-based price increases fully compensatedheadwinds. Our North American operation was also this quarter impacted by lowerprivate label volumes.We continue to expect market demand in 2019 for appliances in Europe to beslightly positive and in Southeast Asia to be positive. The Latin Americanmarket recovered in the quarter and is, hence, anticipated to be slightlypositive for the full-year. In North America and Australia the markets weresofter than initially expected and our full year view is therefore slightlynegative.The uncertainty on trade tariffs impacts our visibility. Based on currentlevels, we estimate the negative year-over-year impact from raw materials,tariffs and currency to be approximately SEK 1.7-1.9bn in 2019, compared to theprevious estimate of approximately SEK 2.0-2.4bn. We continue to expect price tooffset these significant external headwinds.We firmly believe consumer focused innovation is a key driver to achieveprofitable growth. In 2019, Electrolux turns 100 years old and a strong consumerfocus has been our guiding compass, resulting in ground-breaking productsproviding better living for people. I am therefore excited that 2019 is a launchintensive year, including significant kitchen range launches in Europe and Asia-Pacific. In addition, we are accelerating our consumer focused innovationthrough a new organizational structure, as of January 1, comprising fourregional business areas and a global consumer experience function. In parallel,the preparations for the intended separation of Professional Products areproceeding.I am confident that we are well positioned to create value.Telephone conference 09.00 CETA telephone conference is held at 09.00 CET today, April 26.

Net salesrose to SEK 3,109 million (3,071).  · Adjusted operating profit was SEK 275 million (282), while adjustedoperating profit per tonne amounted to 3.0 kSEK (3.0).  · Profit for the period increased to SEK 184 million (167).  · Basic and diluted earnings per share increased to SEK 2.44 (2.21).  · Cash flow before financing activities decreased to SEK –173 million (192)and includes capital expenditure of SEK –451 million (–123). Of the totalcapital expenditure SEK 339 million relates to the expansion of the USproduction facilities.  · Net debt increased to SEK 3,057 million at 31 March 2019 (SEK 2,494 millionat 31 December 2018), corresponding to 2.2 times adjusted EBITDA* (1.8 times at31 December 2018). Net debt at 31 March 2019 includes leasing liabilities of SEK269 million due to IFRS 16 Leases**.* Adjusted for items affecting comparability, see Note 5 for furtherinformation.** See Note 1 for further information on IFRS 16 Leases.Comments by Gränges’ CEO Johan Menckel:The softer market conditions that we experienced in the end of 2018 continued inthe beginning of this year. The lower market demand resulted in a sales volumedecline of 4 per cent to 90.8 ktonnes in the first quarter 2019. The adjustedoperating profit remained fairly stable and amounted to SEK 275 million in thequarter. The result includes costs for the US expansion projects of SEK 17million, whereas a refund of US 232 tariffs had a positive impact of SEK 9million. Exchange rate fluctuations had a positive impact on adjusted operatingprofit of SEK 44 million during the quarter.During the first quarter market conditions were especially challenging in Asia,where the sales volume to automotive customers declined by 13 per cent. This wasdriven by a significant slowdown of the light vehicle production in China incombination with destocking in the supply chain. In Europe and Americas, theautomotive sales volume declined by 4 and 2 per cent respectively in thequarter. With regards to the HVAC & Other business, the market demand inAmericas continued to be strong in the quarter. Sales volume however decreasedby 1 per cent compared with 2018 due to production capacity limitations whichare partly a result of the ongoing expansion projects.Ensuring a sustainable businessHow we plan and run our business today has a profound impact on the future andwe believe that the demand for sustainable products will increase going forward.To secure Gränges’ long-term competitiveness and growth, we recently launched aset of ambitious and clear long-term sustainability targets which demonstrateour commitment to sustainability and our strong focus on integratingsustainability into everything we do. Our products promote a circular approachand enable customers and end-users to achieve significant savings in energyconsumption and greenhouse gas emissions. We are also convinced thatsustainability measures can increase our financial top and bottom-line with anincreased demand for sustainable offerings.OutlookThe global automotive market is expected to continue to slow down in the secondquarter of 2019. The research firm IHS estimates that light vehicle productionwill decrease by 3 per cent globally in the second quarter but return to growthin the second half of the year, resulting in a stable outlook for the full year.For the second quarter Gränges expects a decline in sales volume by mid-singledigits. For automotive materials we foresee a mid to high-single digit reductiondriven by decreasing light vehicle production and continued destocking in thesupply chain, primarily in Asia but also partly in Europe. In Americas we expecta stable development for the HVAC & Other business in the second quarter.As we look further into the year, we will continue to work actively withinnovation and a more sustainable customer offering, which includes an increasedfocus on product development for electric vehicles. Demand for advanced heatexchanger materials for electric vehicles is expected to increase significantlyin the coming years, as more car manufacturers choose liquid cooling solutionsfor batteries. In the US the demand for HVAC and other products continues to bestrong. The expansion of the facility in Huntingdon is expected to be finalizedin mid-2019 and the capacity at the facility in Newport will gradually beresumed during the second half of the year. Altogether, we are determined tocontinue to grow with sustainable profitability in the coming years.Johan Menckel, CEOWebcasted telephone conferenceCEO Johan Menckel and CFO Oskar Hellström will present Gränges’ interim reportfor January–March 2019 at a webcasted conference call at 10.00 CEST, Friday 26April, 2019.The webcast is available on www.granges.com/investors.

In addition, the operating margin atTobii Pro remained high at 20% also in this quarter. With continuedbreakthroughs in new segments and markets, as well as operating costs that haveleveled off, I am optimistic about the continuation of the year.”First quarter January-March 2019  ·  Consolidated net sales rose by 34% to SEK 393 million (294) compared withthe first quarter of 2018. Adjusted for currency effects, the increase was 20%.  ·  The gross margin was 68% (70%).  ·  The Group's operating loss amounted to SEK -37 million (-37). Tobii Dynavox contributed SEK 19 million (14) and Tobii Pro SEK 23 million(15), while investments in Tobii Tech had a negative impact of SEK -80 million (-66) on the Group's operating loss.  ·  Earnings per share amounted to SEK -0.33 (-0.33).  ·  The Group is applying IFRS 16 Leasing for the first time, which has had apositive impact of SEK 7 million on consolidated EBITDA and SEK 1 million onconsolidated EBIT. Please see the tables on page 16 for more information.Significant events  ·  In conjunction with the CES tech show in January Tobii presented its newIS5 eye-tracking platform and Dell launched the Alienware Area 51-m gamingnotebook as the first product with integrated IS5.  ·  Tobii announced a contract with HTC for delivery of eye-tracking technologyfor the HTC Vive Pro Eye VR headset.  ·  Tobii issued bonds of SEK 300 million to fund acquisitions.  ·  British competition authority CMA announced its intention to continue toinvestigate acquisition of the British company Smartbox Assistive TechnologyLtd, in a Phase II investigation. Consequently, it has not been possible tobegin integration.  ·  After the end of the quarter Tobii launched the next generation of TobiiAware, a software solution that enables more intuitive computers. Shipments ofcomputers with Tobii Aware is expected to begin in the second quarter.Events after the end of the period  ·  Tobii’s co-founder Mårten Skogö left his position as Chief Science Officerat and his position in Group Management. At the same time, Mårten has beenproposed to serve as a new member on Tobii’s Board of Directors.Comments from the CEOTobii has had a good start of the year with sales increases in all businessunits. Overall, sales increased by 34 percent, and 20 percent adjusted forcurrency, compared with the first quarter of 2018. Sales also grew sequentiallydespite a strong fourth quarter in 2018. In addition, the operating margin atTobii Pro remained high at 20% also in this quarter. With continuedbreakthroughs in new segments and markets, as well as operating costs that haveleveled off, I am optimistic about the continuation of the year.Tobii Dynavox increased sales an impressive 40% compared with the first quarterof 2018. The sharp increase can be explained in part by the acquisition ofSmartbox and favorable currency effects. Adjusted for these factors, salesgrowth was 10%. Organic sales increased both for our new touchscreen productsand for our eye-controlled products. We see solid growth in both establishedmarkets such as the US, Sweden and Norway, as well as in less developed markets,such as Eastern Europe. This accomplishment indicates the continued large growthpotential in the market and for Tobii Dynavox as market leader. To takeadvantage of this po-tential we continue to invest in product and marketdevelopment and during the quarter, we have trained about 7,000 therapists,prescribers and other key individuals all over the world.The British competition authority CMA’s review of the Smartbox acquisition isstill in pro-gress and has now entered a second phase. Consequently, non-recurring costs and the delay in beginning the integration process have had anegative impact on the financial performance for the quarter. We are cooperatingwith the CMA and continue to believe that the acquisition does not inhibitcompetition rather, it is good for our customers, for Smartbox and for us. Welook forward to a final decision from the CMA in late July so that we cancontinue the process.Tobii Pro delivered yet another strong quarter with an operating margin of animpressive 20% and sales growth of 7%, adjusted for currency effects, even witha strong comparative quarter. In line with our strategy, we organized thebusiness into the three segments “Scientific Research,” “Market Research andUser Experience” and “Professional Performance” during the quarter. We seefavorable growth opportunities in all three segments, and the change will enableus to more effectively address the varied needs of the segments and createcustomized offerings of both services and products. We continue to invest inbroadening and refining our product portfolio, including the launch of a newversion of our software Tobii Pro Lab during the quarter. We achieved keybreakthroughs in China during the quarter within Market Research, as well as inNorth America within Professional Performance. We also opened a new sales officein Singapore. Overall, Tobii Pro continues its high pace of businessdevelopment.In Tobii Tech, currency-adjusted sales towards external customers increased by36%, and by 21% in total. The primary focus is on the three segments PC, VR andNiche applications.Sales kicked off during the quarter for Dell’s Alienware Area 51-m, the firstcomputer with our new IS5 eye-tracking platform. We can clearly see that the IS5design has triggered interest in eye tracking in PCs and we are currentlyengaged in discussions with several major OEM manufacturers. After the end ofthe quarter we launched a completely new generation of Tobii Aware, a softwaresolution that makes it possible to develop more intuitive computers with forinstance improved privacy and security. The first shipments of Tobii Awareenabled PCs to customers are expected in the second quarter.Within Niche applications we added several new customers during the quarter. Thesegment already accounts for a substantial portion of Tobii Tech’s sales and Isee continued favorable growth opportunities.Market intelligence firm IDC has updated its VR and AR market forecast andexpects growth by over 50% this year to about 9 million sold units and to 70million units by 2023. The first units with eye tracking are being launched onthe market this year, but we see several clear signs that over the next fewyears eye tracking will become standard in VR and AR products, for instancelaunches by HTC and Microsoft during the quarter. Our goal is to be the market-leading eye-tracking technology provider in this field. HTC is an importantearly customer for us, and we are working closely with them, other customers andthe ecosystem at large to drive adoption of eye tracking. As part of thiseffort, we also launched several new tools for development of software with eyetracking in March.Taken together, we have achieved a good start to the year with sales increasesin all three business units and, as planned, operating costs that have leveledoff. We continue to be optimistic about achieving our financial goals.Conference callToday at 1:00 p.m. CET, Tobii will host a conference call with web castpresentation for media, analyst and investors.

This has continued into the first quarter of 2019, and themost marked slowdown was in China. On Bulten’s main market, Europe, theslowdowns in the car industry are primarily being caused by consumer concernsabout the effects of a possible hard Brexit as well as new environmentalregulations, rather than a general economic downturn. The fact that the marketfor economically sensitive heavy vehicles remained strong substantiates thisview.Net sales fell by 5% compared to the very strong first quarter of 2018.Investments being made in increased capacity and productivity will increaseearning potential in the longer term. The new heat treatment line inHallstahammar went into production at the end of March and will bring efficiencyenhancements during the second quarter. The previously announced relocation ofproduction in China, from Beijing to Tianjin, is proceeding to plan, and iscurrently in the implementation phase including stock build-up. In addition tothe relocation of operations in China, preparedness for Brexit, the ramping upof new projects and a slowdown in demand has increased capital tied up since sixmonths. Activities are ongoing to normalize and improve control at inventorylevels.Operating earnings amounted to SEK 58 million, corresponding to an operatingmargin of 7.1%. The raw material prices that increased dramatically in 2018 havenow stabilized, although at a high level.My first months as CEO have been an intensive, educational experience. Bulten isa strong company with knowledgeable employees and enjoys a very high level ofconfidence among its customers.

LKAB Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB,2019-04-25 13:00:00,"LKAB begins 2019 with increased sales and improved earnings, mainly as a resultof continued high iron ore prices and a strong dollar. Optimising production,increasing volumes and enhancing our competitiveness continue to have priority.Work on making LKAB sustainable in the long term continues through the expansionof exploration, progress on the development programmes and the initiatives tobroaden our business.Net sales increased by just over a billion kronor to MSEK 7,329 (6,227) comparedwith the same quarter the previous year and underlying operating profitincreased by 23 percent to MSEK 2,899 (2,357). The improvement in profit ismainly driven by high iron ore prices and a strong dollar, while lowerdeliveries, mainly as a result of poor weather conditions at the Port of Narvik,had a negative effect. Operating cash flow was strengthened to MSEK 2,500(1,770), as were net financial items which amounted to MSEK 547 (201). The costlevel for the quarter was higher than in the same period last year, mainly as aresult of increased maintenance work, a larger number of employees, higherenergy prices and increased exploration.Strong demand for high-quality iron ore The average global spot price for ironore was USD 83 (74)/tonne for the quarter. Prices for iron ore with a high ironcontent and for highly upgraded iron ore, such as LKAB’s iron ore pellets, areat the same time continuing to increase relative to iron ore with a lower ironcontent. A decrease in the global supply of iron ore pellets is to be expectedfollowing the dam failure in Brazil in January. However, it is uncertain howgreat the shortfall will be and what effect it will have in the longer term.LKAB is continuing to maximise production of highly upgraded products and of thequarter’s total deliveries, 86 (84) percent consisted of pellets.Lower deliveries and production Production in the first quarter amounted to 6.5(7.3) Mt and deliveries to 6.1 (6.8) Mt. Production was affected by minoroperational disruption at the pelletising plant in Kiruna and by maintenancework at the pelletising plant in Svappavaara. At the beginning of February,however, the plant was able to be started up again after the four-month stoppagefor maintenance. Deliveries were affected by lower production and difficultweather conditions in Narvik, as a result of which shipping had to be suspendedat times during the quarter.”We have had a number of quarters with really good market conditions and thereis a strong long-term trend for steel companies to demand input materials thatresult in higher productivity and lower carbon dioxide emissions. Succeeding inmaximising volumes in our existing production system is key to enabling ourcontinued investments in the next generation of LKAB,” says Jan Moström,President and CEO of LKAB.Next generation LKAB – progress according to planSince the second half of 2018 LKAB has increased its exploration efforts inorder to secure a basis for decisions on the future investments required tosecure production after 2030.During the quarter the exploration work continued according to plan, with thefocus on drifting in Kiruna in order to investigate the extent of themineralisation northwards and downwards below the current main haulage level of1365 m. The aim is to secure a billion tons of mineral resources within fiveyears.In parallel with the expansion of exploration efforts LKAB is conductingextensive development programmes aimed at more sustainable future mining andsteelmaking processes. The collaborative initiatives Sustainable UndergroundMining (SUM) and Hydrogen Ironmaking Breakthrough Technology (HYBRIT) continuedaccording to plan during the quarter.The steel structures for the HYBRIT pilot facility have begun to be erectedwithin SSAB’s industrial area at Svartön in Luleå, and the plan is that thefacility will be able to start up by next summer. Four different sub-projectsare being conducted under the SUM umbrella, including a project to developautonomous, smart, carbon-free vehicles for within the mine.During the quarter LKAb also announced the decision to invest MSEK 45 in pilotfacilities in Malmfälten and Uppsala with the aim of industrialising newtechnology to recycle phosphorus and rare earth elements from residual productsfrom the iron ore production.“LKAB will be one of the most innovative, resource-efficient and responsiblecompanies in the industry. With our expertise and experience in mining andprocessing, we are working to create a broader LKAB that will be less sensitiveto fluctuations in the iron ore market,” says Jan Moström.Contact: Bo Krogvig, Senior Vice President of Communications and Public Affairsat LKAB, Tel: 46 (0)8 429 34 45.

Pricer AB,2019-04-25 12:00:00,"- High growth in net sales and improved profitabilityFirst quarter 2019  · Net sales of SEK 261.9 M (180.0), an increase of 45 percent compared to thesame period last year  · Operating profit of SEK 17.6 M (9.0), corresponding to an operating marginof 6.7 percent (5.0)  · Order intake of SEK 208 M (189), an increase of 10 percent compared to thesame period last year  · Order backlog increased to SEK 169 M (143), of which the majority isexpected to be invoiced in the next quarter  · Net profit for the period was SEK 19.3 M (5.8)  · Earnings per share were SEK 0.18 (0.05)  · Cash flow from operating activities was SEK 55.1 M (28.0)  · As of January 1, 2019, the company applies IFRS 16 for the Group’s leases.The restatement had a negative impact on the period’s earnings of SEK -0.2 M, apositive impact on cash flow from operating activities of SEK 2.2 M and anegative impact on the cash flow from financing activities of SEK -2.2 M. Theequity/assets ratio decreased by 3 percentage points due to an increase in thebalance sheet total. Comparative figures have not been restated.Comments from CEO Helena HolmgrenThe year started strong with growth in net sales of 45 percent during the firstquarter compared to the same period last year. In turn, this resulted in anoperating profit that increased to SEK 17.6 M (9.0).Order intake of SEK 208 M (189) comes from a large number of orders from severalcustomers with a broad geographic distribution. The larger customer base can inthe future result in new orders and in turn reduces vulnerability and dependenceon large individual customer projects.The demand for our system continues to be high, and we are noting for the firstquarter continued high market activity with an increasing number of customerdialogues and several new pilot installations.Positive currency effects from a weaker SEK against USD and EUR, as well asprice reductions on a number of standard components, contributes to the grossmargin in Q1 2019 of 29.1 percent (27.4). The product and contract mix duringthe first quarter of the year is approximately the same as in the comparisonperiod last year.Cash flow from operating activities amounted to SEK 55.1 M (28.0) for the firstquarter and was the result of an operating profit combined with decreasedworking capital.Competition on the market continues to be tough. Significant customer projectsoften attract a large number of vendors of which several primarily aim to gainmarket share at any price. While retailers evaluate the return of their long-term investment in an ESL-system, the system's functionality, stability, updatespeed and future development opportunities are judged differently in theinvestment calculations.We are convinced that the benefits of our unique system, such as speed,reliability, scalability and battery life, respond better to the challengesfacing the retail industry than any of our competitors’ systems. The increase incustomer dialogues and new pilot installations are proof that our long-term andcommitted efforts to continuously improve the system’s performance andfunctionality with new innovative solutions are leading us down the right path.We will continue to dedicate the same effort to our innovative work in order tofurther improve the system’s capacity and thus create even more added value forour customers. Our strong market position is the result of our ability to offerreliable and fast real-time communication in the physical store environment.This in turn creates conditions for innovative logistics models, streamlining ofseveral employee-intensive store processes and an improved and more personalshopping experience for consumers in the store.Pricer acts in an immature market where the penetration rate of ESL systems islow and paper labels remain the most widely used solution. Independent sourcesexpect the market for ESL-systems to grow by around 15-20 percent on an annualbasis in the next few years. We are therefore investing in product development,IT systems, market presence and competence to meet this growth. As part of theseefforts, we moved into larger premises in Stockholm in March to prepare foradditional reinforcements, primarily in our product and developmentorganization. At the same time, we also strengthened our sales presence in anumber of geographic markets to meet the increase in demand.Helena HolmgrenPresident and CEOEvery care has been taken in the translation of this document.

AQ Group AB,2019-04-25 08:00:00,"First quarter, January-March 2019in brief  · Continued good growth, improved profit and strong cash flow  · Net sales increased by 14.9% to SEK 1 253 million (1 090)  · Operating profit (EBIT) increased by 33.8 % to SEK 96 million (72)  · Profit after financial items (EBT) increased by 35.9 % to SEK 93 million(68)  · Profit margin before tax (EBT %) was 7.4 % (6.3)  · Cash flow from operating activities increased by 378 % to SEK 165 million(35)  · Earnings per share after tax increased by 32.3 % to SEK 4.14 (3.13)  · Equity ratio 54 % (61), first quarter 2019 affected by new IFRS 16 rulesA word from the CEOFirst quarterAQ Group grows 14.9% in the quarter and increases operating profit (EBT) by35.9%. The earnings improvement comes from a higher turnover in many of ourcompanies, while we no longer have losses in the companies that we restructuredin 2018.A strong operating cash flow of SEK 165 million is also gratifying. The cashflow improvement comes from intensive efforts to reduce overdue accountsreceivable, which were high at year-end. We also see good effect from theprojects we conduct in our factories to increase the stock turnover rate.MarketWe continue to increase our business both with existing and new customers. Thecomparable organic growth is 9.1% and compensates by a margin for the operationswe discontinued last year. Some good examples of growth in the quarter are, e.g.our wiring systems factory in Mexico with a new customer who makes delivery carsfor global logistics companies. The Inductive Components business area has had agood development driven by the ongoing trend towards more electrified solutions.We are also delivering a larger order for complete machines to a customer inmedical technology. Finally, our operations for automation and electricalcabinets have had high deliveries from their factories in Bulgaria and Sweden.In our role as a supplier, AQ is always ready for changes in demand. We need tobe quick to change both in growth and when demand for our customers' productsdecreasesSupply capabilityIn AQ Group, we work intensively at all our companies to become an even bettersupplier to demanding industrial customers.We remain aware that we have not lived up to some of our customers' expectationsof, above all, delivery reliability. Just under a third of our manufacturingunits have unsatisfactory delivery reliability. Often caused by a sharp increasein order intake but also because of system change, component shortage and lackof machine capacity. We are not happy with this and work hard to improveroutines, standards and processes to become even more robust and flexible in thefuture. One part of this is capacity expansion and machine investments. Duringthe quarter, for example, we have installed a new modern 3D laser cuttingmachine in our unit in Lyrestad and we installed a 1500-tonne plastic injectionmolding machine in Torslanda.OrganisationAQ Group has a strong company culture with values that are for real in customerfocus, entrepreneurship, simplicity, cost efficiency, courage and respect.We run our business in decentralized companies with talented leaders andemployees who work close to their customers and have a mandate to run thebusiness. In this way, we can be quick and utilize all the opportunitiesavailable in the market. This is a strategy we will continue with.AcquisitionsAcquisitions are an important part of AQ's strategy to strengthen our presenceand ability in the product areas and geographical markets where we seeopportunities for growth and improved profitability.Another central part of the acquisition strategy is to follow some of our mostimportant customers into new geographical areas. The integrations of AQ B3CG andAQ Mecanova are now completed, and not least AQ B3CG in North America hascontributed to the increasing profit in the quarter.OutlookOur guideline is to be a long-term, stable, growing and profitable group with aprofit margin (EBT) of 8% and a strong financial position. We like to dobusiness with the customer in focus. Our employees and managers are doing a goodjob and it will also be reflected in new business in the future.With strong relationships with world-leading customers and committed employees,we will work hard with new acquisitions, continued organic growth, good cashflow and a stable profit level. A continued important part of this is our corevalues and our efforts to be a long-term and Reliable supplier to leadingindustrial customers.Anders CarlssonCEO_________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________For further information, please contact:Anders Carlsson, CEO, +46 70 513 42 99 or CFO, Mia Tomczak, telephone +46 70-83300 80AQ Group is required to make the information in this press release public inaccordance with the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Securities Markets Act.The information was released by CEO Anders Carlsson for publication at 08:00hours CEST on April 25, 2019._________________________________________________________________________________ ___________AQ in briefAQ is a leading supplier to demanding industrial customers and is listed onNasdaq Stockholm’s main market.The Group consists mainly of operating companies each of which develop theirspecial skills and in cooperation with other companies, provides cost effectivesolutions in close cooperation with the customer.The Group headquarter is in Västerås, Sweden.

We posted a continued strongdevelopment in our stairlifts business, representing 50% of total revenue, withorganic growth of 7.6%. Vehicle Accessibility revenue was essentially on parwith the corresponding quarter last year, however with a positive trajectory asthe supply of vehicles has stabilized. Developments in Patient Handling weremixed. The European business displayed sustained organic growth whereas theNorth American business struggled (-17.2%).First quarter developmentThe organic growth was negative 0.6% (2.7%) in the first quarter, principallyexplained by the weak performance in Patient Handling North America.Accessibility revenue grew organically 5.7%. Within Accessibility, ourStairlifts business continued to outgrow the market and reported organic growthof 7.6%. Stairlifts North America had a soft start to the quarter, partlyrelated to the ERP issues described in the year-end report, reducing itsquarterly growth to 6.1%. However, the trajectory in the second half of thequarter was back to double digit growth. Patient Handling revenue decreasedorganically by 9.6%. Patient Handling Europe reported organic growth well abovemarket growth. Revenue in Patient Handling North America decreased by 17.2%compared to the first quarter 2018, the strongest quarter in 2018, on the backof soft sales in the US Institutional segment.Adjusted EBITA amounted to MEUR 5.5 (5.1) in the first quarter. The adjustedEBITA margin improved to 7.6% (7.2%) resulting from decreased operatingexpenses. Gross margin decreased slightly to 41.0% (41.4%). Gross margin was up3.9 ppts on the fourth quarter 2018 as most of the items negatively impactingthe fourth quarter margin were one-off in nature. Accessibility adjusted EBITAincreased to MEUR 6.8 (5.6) driven by improved operating leverage. Gross marginwas largely unchanged. Patient Handling adjusted EBITA decreased to MEUR 1.2(1.8) and was attributable to a decreased gross margin and reduced costabsorption in the North American business. Puls reported adjusted EBITA of MEUR0.4 (0.4).Patient Handling North AmericaRevenue decreased by 17.2% primarily explained by US Institutional customers.This business is impacted by larger installation projects, which were relativelyfew in the quarter compared to the corresponding quarter last year. Revenue inthe other segments in Patient Handling North America was broadly flat. In thefirst quarter we made some key changes to the North America organisation. Theseincluded (i) new management team, joined mid-February, (ii) separation of the USand Canadian commercial organisations and (iii) integration of North Americainto our global operations organisation. The new management team has continuedto refine our commercial excellence and go-to-market approach as well as theorder to cash processes. Key activities in the quarter included:  · Improved sales efficiency and monitoring: This includes call rate, number ofcustomer visits, number of quotations and win-rate management.  · Reviewed sales force performance and geographical presence: As a result,three additional institutional sales representatives will be recruited in thesecond quarter. This investment will be funded from other parts of theorganisation.  · Improved order to cash processes: This includes customer service responsetime, technical service first contact resolutions, delivery time, number offulfilled shipments and cash collection.  · Improved value proposition: Focus on solution selling targeted at decreasingdependency on larger installation projects and increase recurring sales of highmargin soft goods (e.g. slings).  · Strategic contracts: Increased focus on Hospital Integrated DeliveryNetworks and Veterans Association contracting to maximise sales under existingand new contracts.I am confident that the new management team and their action plan will returnthe North American Patient      Handling business to growth in the second halfof 2019.Staffan TernströmPresident and CEOAuditors’ review reportThis report has not been reviewed by the company’s auditorsTelephone conferenceA telephone conference, hosted by Staffan Ternström, President and CEO, andStephan Révay, CFO, will be held at 10:00 a.m. CET on 25 April 2019.

"SKF, AB",2019-04-25 08:00:00,"Gothenburg, 25 April 2019Alrik Danielson, President and CEO:“Demand in the first quarter developed in line with our expectations. Net salesreached SEK 21.3 billion and organic sales were relatively unchanged compared tolast year. Operating profit, at SEK 2.7 billion, was strong.Our operating margin was 12.5%, as positive pricing and efforts to reduce ourunderlying cost base continue to show results. This is especially encouraginggiven that we had a negative effect from higher raw material prices in thequarter. Cash flow was SEK 684 million (SEK 259 million last year), a clear year-over-year improvement but still a focus for us to continue to improve during2019.The industrial business delivered a strong operating margin of 15.4% (15.0% lastyear) and an organic growth of 3%. Sales grew in all of our three main markets:Europe, Asia and North America.The automotive business delivered a 5.5% operating margin (7.7% last year) and anegative organic sales development of 5.9%. The business was negatively impactedby significantly reduced sales volumes in North America and lower sales volumesin Europe and Asia. In general, performance across the truck market was strongerthan cars across all regions, except for Latin America, where we saw strongsales also to the car segment.We continue to place significant emphasis on strengthening our balance sheet,improving cash flow and minimising the impact of cost inflation. These effortsare showing on the bottom line and my firm belief is that SKF is in a very goodposition entering a market with slowing demand.In the second quarter of 2019, we expect to see slightly lower volumes for theGroup, relatively unchanged for Industrial and lower for Automotive.”Key figures, SEKm                                 Q1 2019  Q1 2018Net sales                                          21,278    20,560Operating profit                                    2,658     2,625Operating margin, %                                  12.5      12.8Profit before taxes                                 2,442     2,425Net cash flow after investments before financing      684       259Basic earnings per share                             3.77      3.77Net sales change y-o-y, %,  Organic   Structure   Currency   TotalQ1SKF Group                        0.3        -2.5        5.7     3.5Industrial                       3.0        -3.6        6.0     5.4Automotive                      -5.9         0.0        5.0    -0.9Organic sales change in local     Europe      North     Latin  Asia   Middlecurrencies, per region y-o-y, %,           America   America          East &Q1                                                                    AfricaSKF Group                             0.9       0.1       2.1    0.0    -8.3Industrial                             ++        ++         +      +      --Automotive                             --       ---        ++     --     ---Outlook and guidanceDemand for Q2 2019 compared to Q2 2018The demand for SKF’s products and services is expected to be slightly lower forthe Group, including relatively unchanged demand for Industrial and lower demandfor Automotive.

This resulted from strong organic growth of 5%, acquired net growth of3%, and positive currency effects of 8%.All divisions reported organic growth. Growth continued to be particularlystrong in the Americas and Global Technologies divisions. Entrance Systems andEMEA reported good growth while Asia Pacific’s external growth was flat. Salesgrowth for electromechanical products remains particularly strong and nowrepresents 31% of total sales.Operating income increased by 15% to SEK 3,246 M, driven primarily by goodoperating leverage in Americas and Global Technologies. This was partly offsetby weaker performance in Asia Pacific due to flat external growth, increasinglow-margin intra-group sales and build-up of the new Chinese organization.Seasonal effects always impact the operating cash flow in the first quarter, butthis year cash flow more than doubled versus last year. The improvement wasdriven by the higher earnings combined with actions taken in Q4 2018 to balancethe seasonal variations between Q4 and Q1.Innovation enables growth and leadershipOne of ASSA ABLOY’s strategic objectives is product leadership throughinnovation. To maintain our leading position, more than 2,000 engineers arededicated to continuously developing new solutions for our customers, and thisis reflected in that close to 4% of our sales were invested in R&D in thequarter.Customer focus and innovation efforts pay off in growth and leadership. Sales ofelectromechanical products increased 30% in the quarter, driven by strong salesin the commercial/institutional segment and by smart locks in the US residentialsegment. The global sales potential for smart locks is significant, but weexpect the growth rate to slow down from the second quarter onwards due totougher comparatives. Our innovation efforts are also recognized by independentparties. In March, for instance, our new Tanzanian e-Passport, which has beendesigned and delivered by HID, won an award at the High Security Printingconference in Europe.ASSA ABLOY to acquire majority stake in agta recordIn March we announced the intention to acquire a majority stake in agta record.Subject to anti-trust approval, this will be ASSA ABLOY’s largest acquisition ineight years, and it is expected to add 5% to the revenue base. ASSA ABLOY andagta record complement each other very well, and I am confident that ourcustomers and shareholders will benefit from the strong value we can createtogether.

The distribution business in Swedenalso delivered a somewhat weaker result in the period as a result of anunfavourable channel and product mix. At the same time, the productionbusinesses in Sweden and Poland were going strong in terms of both volume andprofitability which partly compensated the lower result.Steel prices generally remained stable in line with last quarter. However, whatwe see as a temporary decline in the price of aluminium and stainless steelresulted in inventory losses compared to gains last year.Cash flow remained positive as a result of the positive earnings and goodcontrol of working capital. During the quarter, operating activities generated apositive cash flow of SEK 62 M (-1), of which SEK 20 M is an effect of theimplementation of IFRS 16.OutlookDemand in the next quarter is expected to remain strong in the company’s mainmarkets. The steel prices are anticipated to stay at the same level as the firstquarter and the prices of aluminium and stainless steel are expected to recoverafter the first quarter’s decline.Anders Martinsson, President and CEOFor further information, please contact:Anders Martinsson, President and CEOtel.: +46 (0)706-21 02 22, e-mail: anders.martinsson@begroup.comDaniel Fäldt, CFOtel.: +46 (0)705-60 31 75, e-mail: daniel.faldt@begroup.comThis information is information that BE Group AB (publ) is obliged to makepublic pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

Inwido AB,2019-04-25 07:45:00,"This information is such that Inwido AB (publ) is obliged to publish inaccordance with the EU market abuse regulation. The information was submitted bythe below contact persons for publication on 25 April 2019 at 7:45 a.m. CET.A quarter in line with our expectationsJanuary – March 2019  · Net sales rose to SEK 1,443 million (1,391), an increase of 4 percent.Organic growth was a negative 2 percent.  · EBITA increased to SEK 45 million and the EBITA margin increased to3.1 percent.

Operating EBITA amounted to SEK 42 million (56) and theoperating EBITA margin was 2.9 percent (4.0) excluding IFRS 16.  · Earnings per share before dilution, increased to SEK 0.58 (0.54).The CEO comments:""In general, 2019 has begun in line with our expectations. Net sales increasedby 4 percent in the first quarter compared with the corresponding period in thepreceding year, rising to SEK 1,443 million (1,391). Operating EBITA for thequarter was SEK 45 million. The lower earnings and, accordingly, the loweroperating margin at 3.1 percent, were due mainly to an unfavourable mix andinability to fully adjust expenses to the lower volumes for the quarter.Seasonally, the first quarter is Inwido’s weakest, both in terms of sales andearnings.e-Commerce continues to grow strongly and with good profitabilityThe first quarter of 2019 showed very clearly that our long-term commitment toe‑Commerce, our unit for e-trade, is continuing to generate favourable earnings.Sales in these operations increased organically by 33 percent compared with thecorresponding period in 2018, amounting to 9 percent of the Group’s total salesfor the quarter. As we foresaw in the year-end report, we have not, despite thegrowth in e-Commerce, been able to fully offset the unfavourable sales mix tothe Industry market with sales to the more profitable Consumer segment. Orderbookings increased by 8 percent in the first quarter of 2019. At the end of thequarter, the size of the order backlog was at a similar level as at thecorresponding time last year, although the mix is now more advantageous, with ahigher proportion of orders from the Consumer segment. Cash flow from operatingactivities after changes in working capital, which is normally negative in thefirst quarter due to seasonality, this year amounted to SEK 51 million.Strong development in Inwido South and challenges for Inwido NorthBusiness area Inwido South continued to develop very positively in early 2019,partly due to a milder winter compared with last year. Sales increased by19 percent and operating profit more than doubled to SEK 60 million (27).Favourable development in e-Commerce has been complemented by continued strongdevelopment in the Danish operations. The companies in the UK also had apositive quarter. The order backlog at the end of the quarter was 30 percenthigher than at the corresponding time last year and had a favourable mix.Business area North developed more weakly in the period, mainly due to continuednegative development for the larger companies in Finland and Sweden. TheIndustry market continued to weaken during the quarter, in line with reduced newconstruction, while consumer activity was significantly lower during the wintermonths, in line with the normal seasonal pattern. The consequence of this wasthat sales fell by 4 percent to SEK 848 million, while operating profitdecreased to SEK 2 million (39). We were not able to fully offset the volumeloss in business area North with cost savings during the quarter. At the sametime, we are making significant IT investments in our larger companies in Swedenand Finland to strengthen our future competitiveness. Combined, this has had anegative impact on profitability. Order bookings decreased by 3 percent in thequarter, making the order backlog 13 percent lower than at the same time in2018, although with a more favourable segment mix.Future prospectsThe signals from our markets are mixed. The Industry market in both Sweden andFinland is showing few signs of recovery, with expectations of a continueddecline in new construction activity. We are also seeing signs of continuedconsolidation of the builders’ merchant channels in some markets, although it istoo early to judge whether this will affect their operations and ours in thelong term and, if so, how.At the same time, the conditions in the Danish and Norwegian markets are stableand we are seeing a continued underlying need for, and increased interest in,investment in housing in large parts of Europe. We believe we are wellpositioned to meet our customers’ needs and consumers’ changed behaviours – ourrapidly increasing sales in e-commerce are good proof of that. Internally, weare continuing our implementation of the Simplify model, and are already seeingincreased transparency and clarity regarding the capacity to generate results,particularly among the smaller units, providing conditions for further value-generating priorities and investments. Our long-term acquisition strategystands firm and our efforts are continuing to further strengthen the balancesheet to be able to make acquisitions.""MALMÖ, 25 APRIL 2019Henrik HjalmarssonPresident and CEORead the full report in the pdf attachedFor more information, please contact:Henrik Hjalmarsson, President and CEO Tel.: 46 (0)76 846 20 46Peter Welin, CFO and deputy CEO Tel.: 46 (0)703 24 31 90E-mail: peter.welin@inwido.comAbout InwidoInwido owns and develops companies that improve people’s everyday lives indoorswith various products and services.

Operating profit was also up compared to thefourth quarter of 2018, when there were several planned maintenance outages.SSAB Americas’ operating profit rose to SEK 956 (129) million for the firstquarter. This improvement was driven primarily by significantly higher realizedprices compared with the first quarter of 2018. Demand remained strong in mostsegments.SSAB Special Steels saw continued strong demand in most segments. Operatingprofit was SEK 678 (434) million, up SEK 244 million compared with the firstquarter of 2018. A more stable production contributed to the improvement inearnings.Demand in Europe was fairly stable during the first quarter, although rawmaterial prices increased. SSAB Europe carried out repairs and maintenance onone of the blast furnaces in Raahe during the quarter and this, together withsome pressure on margins, pushed the operating profit down to SEK 347 (657)million.All in all, 2019 has started on a positive note, with both SSAB Special Steelsand SSAB Americas reporting record results. A further strengthening of ourbalance sheet creates a sound basis on which to continue to develop the companythrough strategic investments and bolt-on acquisitions. Even if growth in ourhigh-strength steels leveled off somewhat during the quarter, we remain positiveabout the structural growth potential for these products. We continue to addressproduction stability and are stepping up measures to create a safer workplace.We see activity continuing at a good level, especially in Q&T steels and inheavy plate in the USA, whereas somewhat weaker leading economic indicators anda weakening in the automotive industry are contributing to some uncertaintyregarding steel demand going forward.

Edgeware AB,2019-04-25 07:30:00,"“The integration and business opportunities deriving from the acquisition ofCavena have exceeded my expectations”, Karl Thedéen, CEO, EdgewareFIRST QUARTER OF 2019:  · Net sales totalled SEK 53.0 million (48.4), an increase of 9.5 percent.  · Net sales totalled SEK 49.8 million (48.4), excluding newly acquired CavenaImage Products AB, an increase of 2.9 percent.  · Gross profit amounted to SEK 38.7 million (32.3), corresponding to a grossmargin of 73.0 percent (66.7).  · Gross profit amounted to SEK 36.4 million (32.3), excluding newly acquiredCavena Image Products AB, corresponding to a gross margin of 73.1 percent(66.7).  · Operating income (EBIT) was negative SEK 0.7 million (neg: 11.5),corresponding to an operating margin of negative 1.4 percent (neg: 23.7).  · Profit for the period amounted to SEK 0.4 million (loss: 9.2).  · Cash flow from operating activities totalled SEK 18.2 million (6.7).  · Cash flow for the period of SEK 5.6 million (2.1). This includes the cash-flow effect attributable to the acquisition of Cavena Image Products AB of SEK9.1 million.  · Earnings per share for the period before and after dilution were SEK 0.0 pershare (neg: 0.3).SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER  · Edgeware acquired 100% of the shares in Cavena Image Products AB, theleading supplier of subtitles of SEK 8.0 million on a cash and debt-free basis.SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER THE FIRST QUARTER  · Edgeware launched the Virtual Channel Creation solution that enablescustomised “lean-back” TV at the NAB exhibition in Las Vegas.COMMENTS BY THE CEOSales for the first quarter of 2019 were SEK 53 million, which is an increase of10 percent compared with the year-earlier period. Adjusted for acquisitions andforeign exchange rates effect, sales declined by 3 percent. Overall, the firstquarter largely followed the usual seasonal pattern during the year. However, itis pleasing to note that this does not apply to our acquired company, Cavena,which reported a positive start to the year, both in terms of sales and margin.Edgeware’s gross margin amounted overall to a strong 73 percent and, incombination with continued cost-efficiency and measures implemented in 2018,this resulted in an EBIT of negative SEK 0.7 million, despite a relatively weakquarter in terms of sales.The quarter’s sales in the AMERICAS was strong due to larger deliveries to ourmost important customer in the region, which made investments to increase thecapacity of its network. APAC also recorded sales growth, but from lower levels.EMEA recorded a weaker quarter in terms of sales, due largely to strong sales toa number of major customers in EMEA during the fourth quarter of 2018.We foresee continued opportunities relating to the CDN business. The number ofusers of new TV services is increasing, as is the use of such services as time-shift and the possibility of consuming TV services on various types of devices.Our CDN solution is also world-leading and we have excellent references frommany major customers. In particular, we see opportunities outside Europe, wheremarket growth is largest. Our own strong growth in LATAM is a confirmation ofthis. However, the development for our large EMEA CDN-customers is harder topredict following some years of relatively high investment levels.To broaden our product portfolio and create a more attractive offering for ourcustomers, we intensified our focus on innovation and the development ofprototypes during the quarter.We can see already now that the acquisition of Cavena has had a positive effectas it has created dialogue with new customers and we continue to believe,therefore, in acquisition as a complement to proprietary product development.When it comes to our own product development for this customer group, wecontinue to focus strongly on our origin solution, with unique functions fordynamic ad insertion, subtitling, and Virtual Cannel Creation. At the beginningof the current quarter, we will launch our origin solution as a cloud-basedservice through Amazon Web Services, which will be a key milestone on thejourney to creating a new type of software business.During the quarter, we gained a small but strategic new order for our originsolution from a Nordic broadcaster. This customer is highly advanced, has amodern platform and uses cloud-based technology to be fast, flexible and able tofocus on business rather than operational aspects. Crucial in their choice ofsupplier was the combination of functions for personalised advertising and thatour products are suitable for cloud-based solutions. We regard this asconfirmation that we have chosen the right path.In summary, the quarter followed the seasonal variations of earlier years, withrelatively low sales. The acquisition of Cavena developed favourably, we secureda new, important customer in the broadcasting segment and won an important CDNorder in AMERICAS. We will continue our effort to expand our product portfolioand cultivate new customers.Karl ThedéenCEO, EdgewareAt 10:00 a.m. on 25 April 2019, the company will hold a web-broadcastteleconference, during which CEO Karl Thedéen will present the report togetherwith CFO Annika Norin.Anyone wishing to participate in the teleconference in conjunction with thepresentation should call one of the numbers below:SE: +46856642692UK: +443333009263US: +18338230590It is also possible to follow and listen to the presentation on the followingweb link: https://tv.streamfabriken.com/edgeware-q1-2019Contact:                             Annika Norin, CFO                                           Tel: +46708856774, E-mail:annika.norin@edgeware.tvThis information is inside information that Edgeware AB (publ) is obliged tomake public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

NorthAmerica remains a strong market with healthy demand from vehicle manufacturers.We’ve had a rough winter that caused losses in production and shipping days,which impacted Aftermarket in the US negatively. Nevertheless, net sales are upfor the region as a whole. Europe’s sales have been stable in Q1, although theforecast for new production of trailers, which is a key customer group for us,is negative.China is responsible for the major decline of the quarter. Legislation wasenacted last year requiring automatic brake adjusters in newly produced heavyvehicles. As a result, our net sales in China almost doubled in Q1. Thecomparative figures are thus high, but China is currently a rough market withdeclining volumes and heavy price pressure. The legislation is not followed andthe penetration of trailers is as low as 30 percent. However, we estimate thatthe safety requirements will lead to an increase in demand for Haldex productsin the long term.Shift to disc brakes in North AmericaInterest in disc brakes is growing among fleets, which is a precondition forvehicle manufacturers to bring up their disc brake sales volumes. Anothertrailer manufacturer chose Haldex disc brakes as the standard brake for theirvehicles during the quarter. Working via fleets takes time, but we know frompast experience that it is an effective way of building long-term demand. Haldexis known for its good relationships with fleets, which is one of the reasonsbrake adjusters were such a big success in North America. Haldex still commandsa position as the absolute market leader for this product. We are continuing tobuild up the supply chain in North America for local disk brake production withthe first round of production scheduled for the beginning of next year. Haldex’snew disc brake for trucks is currently being tested and it is estimated thatproduction will begin later this year.Improved operating margin and continued streamliningThe increased costs of raw materials and tarriffs in the US have a delay beforethey can be passed on to customers. The scheduled price adjustments in Q1 tocompensate for increased raw material prices and tarriffs have been implementedand are one of the reasons for the improvement to our operating margin.As a result of the increased international focus on tarriffs, supply chains mayneed to be modified and we are evaluating what we will manufacture ourselves andwhat strategic partners will offer. The supply chain in each region is currentlybeing reviewed to further optimize manufacturing and logistics.In the Aftermarket, we are continuing our efforts to increase net income andbroaden our product range. An analysis of the entire product range is underwayto refine the existing product portfolio. With a few thousand product variationsin the portfolio, small-scale products need to be phased out and non-profitableproducts divested or closed down. During the quarter, an agreement was signed todivest the rotary connector for construction machinery as a part of theseefforts.I am convinced that the streamlining measures we introduced and will continue toroll out will enable Haldex to reach a 10 percent operating margin, excludinginvestments in new technology. The operating margin for Q1 excluding newtechnology was 7.5%. We will not be satisfied until we have reached ourprofitability target, and we will optimize our cost base and identify areas forcontinuing growth.New technology for electric and self-driving vehiclesThe new technology developed by Haldex is brought together under the ”ScalableBrake System” name. As of this quarterly report, we are reporting this as itsown product line, to better show the development and simplify the follow-up. InFebruary, I got to visit our winter tests in Arjeplog. For the third winter in arow, we tested FABV, which is one of the first Scalable Brake System products.The feeling of riding in a self-driving vehicle on snow and ice, that brakedwith Haldex technology, was amazing. Our offering, which will challenge the twomajor industry players, has a promising future.One of the other Scalable Brake System products is the electromechanical brake.We are continuing to conduct tests on vehicles on test tracks and are makinggood progress. However, we see that customers are not really ready to beginplacing orders in the end of 2020 as we previously estimated. Instead, sometimeduring 2021 is more likely.Outlook for 2019The market in North America is expected to continue to grow in 2019. However,the North American market can fluctuate rapidly, and it is difficult to estimatewhether the growth will last the entire year. Europe is judged to slighlydecrease compared with 2018. China has a weaker market in 2019. Haldex canpartly withstand a downturn given that automatic adjusters are currentlyrequired by law on heavy vehicles. India is expected to have a weak year withlower production levels, and Brazil is expected to experience carefullyoptimistic market growth, although from low levels.Our outlook for 2019 has not changed. We make the assessment that sales willincrease in North America, which will be offset by unchanged or lower sales inother regions. As a whole, sales in 2019 are expected to be in line with 2018.Haldex makes the assessment that the operating margin in 2019, includingincreased investments in new technology, will be in line with or higher than theoperating margin excluding one-off items in 2018.”Full interim reportThe full interim report is available athttp://corporate.haldex.com/en/investors/financialreports or athttp://news.cision.com/haldexPress and analyst meetingMedia and analysts are invited to a telephone conference at which the reportwill be presented with comments by Åke Bengtsson, President and CEO and AndreasLarsson, CFO.

Sales growth of18 %, of which 11 % in local currencies, is strong! It was also the 19thconsecutive quarter of sales growth showing that we are in a period of strongdevelopment! Operating result rose from SEK 18.6 million to SEK 46.0 million andresult for the period increased from SEK 6.0 million to SEK 26.0 million. Bothresults are all-time high for a first quarter.NET SALESAll our three segments had growth. Sports & Leisure continued to develop verystrongly and showed 21 % growth. Corporate was not far behind with growth of 19% and Gifts & Home Furnishings managed to cross the zero line, even if growthwas a modest 2 %. The Group's net sales passed some milestones as it was thefirst time we crossed the SEK 1.5 billion for a first quarter – and the firsttime we crossed the SEK 6.5 billion on a rolling 12 months (SEK 6,523 million).We probably had a somewhat positive effect compared to the previous year asEaster this year is in the second quarter.RESULTThe first quarter is always the weakest but it is still very nice to begin theyear well. For the quarter to achieve an operating result of SEK 46.0 millionand a result for the period of SEK 26.0 million pleases me. We also pass amilestone in terms of operating result and for the first time we passed SEK 500million on a rolling 12-month period.BALANCE SHEETIFRS 16, which we report according to for the first time, affects the comparisonbetween the years and the new standard has resulted in an increase in net debtby SEK 633.2 million. In addition, the quarter was affected significantly bychanges in exchange rates which increased stock by SEK 103.8 million. But I amsatisfied that we have a strong balance sheet with an equity ratio of almost 46% despite IFRS 16.THE FUTUREI still feel that we stand very strong! Even in the future there can be quartersthat are less favorable but I am confident that the investments we have alreadymade will generate growth in both sales and result for many years to come! It isa tremendous benefit for me to lead such a strong and driven organisation whichwe currently have and skilled staff are essential for success.

Operational free cash flow from continuing operations rose toSEK 4,409 million (4,256). Total cash flow amounted to SEK 1,936 million(9,012).  · Outlook 2019 is reiterated.Comments by Johan Dennelind, President & CEO“Dear shareholders and Telia followers, as we said already in connection to thefourth quarter report 2018 and at our Capital Markets Day in March, we expecteda soft start to 2019. This is also shown in the first quarter performance, butwe see no reason to change our view that a slower earnings trend in the firsthalf of 2019 will be followed by a stronger second half. The improving trendsthrough the year is expected to be supported by effects from price increasesimplemented as of April 1, 2019, impact from already signed contract wins, costreduction measures and gradual increased execution of synergies both in Norwayfrom the Get acquisition and from the new operating model.Our prime focus continues to be to increase the operational free cash flow and Iam pleased to see a SEK 0.2 billion growth from the first quarter of 2018. Thisis driven by EBITDA and working capital. Service reve-nues on group level, likefor like, declined 3 percent, with mobile service revenues declining 2 percent.Like for like, adjusted EBITDA declined 4 percent (excluding IFRS 16 impact),which is slightly better than we saw, based on January and February trading. Theoperational expenses grew 1 percent, but we reiterate that these costs will bereduced by 2 percent on a net basis for 2019.The Swedish operation saw, as expected, a continuous decline in the legacybusiness. Previous quarters the legacy decline has been mitigated by growth incore services. This mitigation was lower this quarter, especially due to weakermobile service revenues. The target to reduce the Swedish operational expensesby 3 percent in 2019 is reiterated. The cost level was flat in the firstquarter. All in all, EBITDA declined 6 percent like for like (excluding IFRS 16impact).In Norway we have seen a declining mobile customer base for some time now, whichis the main reason for the mobile service revenue decline. Get is now fullyintegrated, the TDC brand is closed and customers were moved to Telia. Inconnection to the Capital Markets Day in Stockholm on March 26, 2019, we an-nounced an increase in the full run-rate of cash flow synergies from NOK 700million to NOK 800 million. As planned, the synergy realization was limited inthe first quarter of 2019 but will accelerate coming quarters.The Finnish mobile service revenue growth is lower than previous quarters, to alarge extent driven by inter-connect rate cuts. We have seen a strong orderintake in the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019 which will have a positiveeffect on service revenue growth later in 2019.Speaking of contract wins we have during the quarter taken yet anothernarrowband IoT deal, this time including 900,000 units with an electricitydistribution customer. This is a proof point that we are highly competitive inthe IoT market which we see as an important revenue driver in years to come.In the quarter Sweden was enrolled into the new operating model which willincrease focus on commercial execution, improved scale benefits with intendedcost reductions. It is encouraging that we already in the first quarter havebeen able to reduce the external costs within Common Product and Services, whichleads the efficiency streams across our markets stemming from the new operatingmodel. In addition, Norway and Finland will be included in the new operatingmodel later in 2019, which will further add efficiency gains.We believe that it will be a prerequisite from both customers, employees and astakeholder perspective that we have an ambitious environmental agenda. As suchby year 2030, Telia Company targets to have zero waste, zero emissionsthroughout our value chain and a full employee engagement. It is a big bet and abold move, but not only do we see that we can make an impact on the climate, wealso see business opportunities.You can find more details on this as well as our overall integratedsustainability efforts in our annual and sustainability report.The Annual general meeting held on April 10, 2019, approved the proposal fromthe board of a SEK 2.36 dividend per share (of which the first part wasdistributed in April) and gave a mandate for additional share buybacks. We haveinitiated the 2019 program aiming to buy back shares for SEK 5 billion untilFebruary 28, 2020. This implicitly leaves the total shareholder remuneration toSEK 3.55 per share.The outlook of an operational free cash flow of SEK 12.0 to 12.5 billion in 2019is reiterated. Albeit a slow start on service revenues and EBITDA we areconvinced that the measures and steps we have taken to turn the trends willmaterialize in order to continue to create shareholder value.”Johan Dennelind, President & CEOThis information is information that Telia Company AB is obliged to make publicpursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

Lundin Mining Corporation,2019-04-25 00:45:00,"Lundin Mining CorporationInterim report (Q1 and Q3)Lundin Mining First Quarter ResultsNEWS RELEASELundin Mining First Quarter ResultsToronto, April 24, 2019 (TSX: LUN Nasdaq Stockholm: LUMI) Lundin Mining Corporation (“Lundin Mining” or the “Company”) today reported cash flows of $62.1 million generated from operations in its first quarter. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Lundin Mining shareholders were $51.7 million ($0.07 per share) for the quarter ended March 31, 2019.First quarter net earnings include a loss on our equity investment in Freeport Cobalt of $11.9 million ($0.02 per share) which was impacted by an inventory write-down.Marie Inkster, President and CEO commented, “This is a very exciting time for Lundin Mining. We are pleased with our results in the first quarter of 2019 with all mines operating well.We anticipate closing of the recently announced Chapada acquisition early in the third quarter. Ramp-up of the Candelaria underground mines and more ore production from the open pit are expected to increase copper ore grades in the second half of this year. Eagle East remains on schedule for first ore to the mill in the fourth quarter, and the Neves-Corvo Zinc Expansion Project continues to make meaningful development progress.We remain well positioned to deliver 2019 annual production and cost guidance and improved production and cash flow in the coming years.” Summary financial results for the quarter:                        Three months ended          March 31,    US$ Millions (except per share amounts)     2019   20184      Revenue     416.4   470.5      Gross profit     141.2   149.9      Attributable net earnings 1     51.7   81.3      Net earnings     60.9   87.1      Basic and diluted earnings per share2     0.07   0.11      Cash flow from operations     62.1   172.9      Cash and cash equivalents     734.7   1,639.1      Net cash 3     658.9   1,183.2  1 Attributable to shareholders of Lundin Mining Corporation. 2 Basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to shareholders of Lundin Mining Corporation.3 Net cash is a non-GAAP measure defined as cash and cash equivalents, less long-term debt and lease liabilities, before deferred financing fees.4  On adoption of IFRS 16, Leases, the Company has elected not to restate comparative periods presented.HighlightsOperational PerformanceAll metal production exceeded expectations during the first quarter, with the exception of copper which was impacted by lower than planned grades at Neves-Corvo. Metal production for 2019 is expected to achieve annual guidance last reported.Candelaria (80% owned): The Candelaria operations produced, on a 100% basis, 32,778 tonnes of copper, and approximately 20,000 ounces of gold and 320,000 ounces of silver in concentrate during the quarter. Copper production in the quarter was higher than the prior year comparable period primarily due to higher mill throughput. Copper cash costs1 of $1.62/lb for the quarter were marginally higher than full year guidance but lower than the prior year quarter. Candelaria is on track to meet annual 2019 copper production. Copper head grades are expected to increase in the second half of the year as more ore is sourced directly from Phase 10 of the open pit.Ramp-up of the Candelaria Underground mine continues with the North Sector achieving a current production rate of approximately 10,500 tonnes per day. Development of the South Sector is progressing well with a production start-up date now projected by the end of the third quarter of 2019.Eagle (100% owned): Eagle produced 4,213 tonnes of nickel and 3,897 tonnes of copper during the quarter. Nickel and copper production were both lower than the prior year quarter due to planned lower ore grades and severe winter weather conditions which impacted ore transportation to the mill. Nickel cash costs of $0.37/lb for the quarter were better than full year guidance and the prior year comparable period, primarily due the implementation of IFRS 16, Leases which resulted in a reduction in cash costs of $0.11/lb in the current quarter.Development of Eagle East continues to progress ahead of schedule and budget, with first ore scheduled into the mill by the fourth quarter of 2019.Neves-Corvo (100% owned): Neves-Corvo produced 8,868 tonnes of copper and 18,773 tonnes of zinc for the quarter. For copper, the impact of lower head grades was partially offset by higher recoveries this quarter. Zinc head grades, in contrast, were 5% higher than the prior year comparable period and positively impacted production. Copper cash costs of $0.92/lb for the quarter were lower than full year guidance and the prior year period owing to higher-by-product credits.Construction on the Zinc Expansion Project (“ZEP”) was approximately 54% complete at quarter-end. Surface facilities construction continued with the SAG building and flotation equipment installation. Underground development advanced with breakthrough of the last conveyor gallery and continued civil and mechanical construction. Careful monitoring of timeline and cost is ongoing to ensure the project remains on track.Zinkgruvan (100% owned): Zinc production of 21,673 tonnes was higher than the prior year quarter reflecting higher head grades, while lead production of 5,832 tonnes was lower than the prior year quarter due to lower throughput. First quarter zinc cash costs of $0.44/lb were slightly higher than full year guidance but remain on target to achieve annual guidance. Zinc cash costs approximated the prior year comparable period.Total Production    (Contained metal in concentrate - tonnes) 2019   2018    Q1   Total Q4  Q3 Q2 Q1    Coppera 46,122   199,630 48,206 52,770 51,098 47,556    Zinc 40,446   152,041 42,024 36,062 37,075 36,880    Nickel 4,213   17,573 3,501 4,697 4,234 5,141    a - Candelaria's production is on a 100% basis.  Financial PerformanceGross profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 was $141.2 million, a decrease of $8.7 million in comparison to the $149.9 million reported in the first quarter of the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenues as a result of lower sales volumes ($70.4 million), partially offset by lower production costs ($34.7 million) and depreciation expense ($10.8 million).Net earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 were $60.9 million, a decrease of $26.2 million from the $87.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease was attributable to lower gross profit, lower income from equity investment ($16.7 million) and higher income taxes ($5.3 million), partially offset by lower interest expense.Net cash for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 was $658.9 million, a decrease of $145.5 million in comparison to December 31, 2018. The decrease was attributable to lower operating cashflows, increased spend on capital investments, and an increase in lease liabilities of $30.0 million as a result of the implementation of IFRS 16, Leases on January 1, 2019.Financial PositionCash and cash equivalents decreased $80.7 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2019, from $815.4 million to $734.7 million.Cash flow from operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 was $62.1 million, a decrease of $110.8 million in comparison to the $172.9 million reported in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower comparative change in non-cash working capital ($79.4 million) and lower revenue and production costs.Cash used in investing activities increased when compared to the prior year quarter. During the first quarter of 2019, investments in mineral properties, plant and equipment increased to $182.0 million from $150.7 million in the prior year comparable period. The increase in capital investments related primarily to ZEP ($18 million) and the Mine Fleet Reinvestment Program at Candelaria ($12 million).During the quarter, Candelaria completed a $35 million term loan financing to assist with management of short-term working capital.As of April 24, 2019, the cash balance was approximately $760 million.Corporate HighlightsOn April 15, 2019, the Company announced it had entered into a definitive purchase agreement with Yamana Gold Inc. (“Yamana”) to purchase its 100% ownership stake in Mineração Maracá Indústria e Comércio S/A, which owns the Chapada copper-gold mine located in Brazil, for cash consideration of $800 million, subject to customary adjustments. In addition, Yamana will retain a 2.0% net smelter return royalty on future gold production from the Suruca gold deposit and receive contingent consideration of up to $125 million over five years if certain gold price thresholds are met and contingent consideration of $100 million on potential construction of a pyrite roaster.The purchase price is expected to be funded from the Company’s current cash balance and a portion of its $550 million revolving credit facility. Completion of the acquisition is expected to occur early in the third quarter of 2019 and is subject to typical closing conditions, including third-party and requisite regulatory approvals.Outlook2019 Production, Cash Cost and Capital Expenditure GuidanceProduction, cash cost and capital expenditure guidance for 2019 remains unchanged from that provided on November 28, 2018 (see news release “Lundin Mining Provides Operational Outlook & Update”).

Umeå University Hospital in Sweden and Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICOHospitalet) – Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL) in Barcelona arenow part of PanFAM-1 study.We also took an extremely important step towards on the optimization of thealgorithm during Q1. We announced in March that using blood samples that are asfresh as possible, i.e. stored for less than 24 months, increases the testperformance and provides optimal results. We were able to attain the relevantsamples through our large and growing network of clinical Key Opinion Leaders(KOL). It is imperative to note that we needed samples that best mirror theblood samples that will be used with our final product, finding these freshsamples and gaining access to them is quite difficult and takes time.With the appointment of Julie Silber as Senior Investor Relations Director earlythis year we actualized a strategic objective in strengthening the IR role andour shareholder communication capabilities at Immunovia.We continued to work intensely during the first quarter of 2019 on thepreparations for our sales launch targeted for the beginning of 2020.Excerpt from the CEO Mats Grahn’s comment on the report.Key Indicators+----------------------------+----------+----------+----------+--------------+|Key Indicators (SEK thousand|Jan-Mar   |Jan-Mar   |Full year |Full year 2017||unless otherwise stated)    |2019      |2018      |2018      |              |+----------------------------+----------+----------+----------+--------------+|Net Sales                   |66        |112       |333       |149           |+----------------------------+----------+----------+----------+--------------+|Operating earnings          |-27,197   |-17,377   |-87,708   |-45,520       |+----------------------------+----------+----------+----------+--------------+|Earnings before tax         |-26,381   |-17,326   |-86,531   |-45,323       |+----------------------------+----------+----------+----------+--------------+|Net earnings                |-26,384   |-17,326   |-86,536   |-45,232       |+----------------------------+----------+----------+----------+--------------+|Earnings per share before   |-1.35     |-1.00     |-4.67     |-2.67         ||and after dilution          |          |          |          |              ||(SEK/share)                 |          |          |          |              |+----------------------------+----------+----------+----------+--------------+|Equity ratio, %             |89        |94        |97        |94            |+----------------------------+----------+----------+----------+--------------+|No. of shares at the end of |19,531,353|17,318,059|19,531,353|17,318,059    ||the period                  |          |          |          |              |+----------------------------+----------+----------+----------+--------------+This financial statement has been produced in accordance with IFRS for theImmunovia Group, which comprises Immunovia AB and the wholly-owned subsidiariesImmunovia Incentive AB, Immunovia Inc. and Immunovia GmbH.OutlookImmunovia is focused on fundamentally transforming diagnosis of complex forms ofcancer and autoimmune diseases.

Biotage AB,2019-04-24 15:00:00,"New sales record and substantially increased operating profitFirst quarter January - March 2019  · Net sales amounted to 248.0 MSEK (208.0), which is an increase by 19.2percent compared to the corresponding quarter last year. At comparable exchangerates[1] and adjusted for acquisitions, sales increased by 5.8 percent.  · Operating profit increased by 19.8 percent to 49.8 MSEK (41.6).  · Result after tax increased by 5.9 percent to 47.5 MSEK (44.9).  · Earnings per share increased to 0.73 SEK (0.69) before and after dilution.  · The cash flow from operating activities amounted to 11.5 MSEK (28.1).  · Net debt[1] at March 31 amounted to 117.9 MSEK (-59.6). Cash and cashequivalents amounted to 142.6 MSEK (168.9). Liabilities to credit institutionsamounted to 109.4 MSEK (109.3).  · On January 2 the Board of Directors announced that a recruitment process hadbeen initiated to hire a new CEO and that Torben Jørgensen intends to continueas CEO until a replacement has been hired.  · The acquisition of PhyNexus Inc. was completed on January 15. The purchaseprice amounted to approx. 21.3 MUSD, corresponding to approx. 190.6 MSEK[2]. Ofthis sum approx. 4.8 MUSD (approx. 43.2 MSEK) in cash payment and approx. 6.6MUSD (approx. 58.6 MSEK) in newly issued shares was paid in connection withtaking possession. The remaining 10.0 MUSD (approx. 89.3 MSEK) are expectedfuture additional purchase price payments based on future results.  · On January 15 the Board of Directors decided to issue consideration sharesfor the acquisition of PhyNexus. The share issue means that the number of sharesin Biotage has increased from 64,714,447 to 65,201,784, which has resulted in adilution of 0.7 percent for existing shareholders.1) See defintion on pp. 16-172) Based on an exchange rate SEK/USD of 8.93Comments by CEO Torben JörgensenBiotage starts off 2019 with a strong first quarter. The sales during thequarter are the highest ever in the history of Biotage, also taking into accountthe business of PhyNexus, Inc. acquired during the year. We took possession ofthe acquisition on January 15 and the integration is proceeding according toplan. The transfer of PhyNexus’ instrument production to Biotage’s plant inSalem, New Hampshire, has been initiated. We are looking forward to continuingthe development of PhyNexus’ operations in the rapidly growing area of small-scale purification of biomolecules. Biotage has traditionally primarily beenfocusing on purification of small molecules (synthetic) and we are now wideningthe operations to include also biomolecules (biologic). Biotage has not,however, been able to make progress in the discussions concerning an acquisitionof the associated company Chreto A/S, which is also active in the area ofpurification of biomolecules.Efficiency and profitability also increased during the quarter. The gross marginimproved by 0.7 percentage points to 61.7 percent. Contributing factors are animproved mix in the sales of systems and aftermarket products, where we thisquarter have a higher share of aftermarket products with 54 percent of sales.The operating margin for the quarter amounts to 20.1 percent, to be comparedwith Biotage’s new profitability target of an average of 20 percent over a three-year period. On a rolling 36 month basis the operating margin is now 17.7percent. At comparable exchange rates and adjusted for acquisitions, salesincreased by 5.8 percent in the period. In reported sales, we reach a growth of19.2 percent. Biotage’s target is an annual sales growth averaging 8 percentover a three-year period.The cash flow in the quarter is not entirely satisfactory. This is partlyexplained by the fact that we have chosen to tie up more capital in inventoriesby overproducing some of our products manufactured in Cardiff, Wales, inpreparation for a possible Brexit. Another cause is that a comparatively largeshare of the sales took place late in the quarter, which contributed to a lowercash flow by increasing accounts receivable.Biotage continues to show the strongest growth in Asia. The American sales arenot quite where we want them to be. This is partly due to the timing ofbusiness, but we are also struggling to keep the sales organization intact asthe good US economy results in fierce competition for employees.Our single largest product area in organic chemistry, Purification, continues togrow and with global sales of more than 250 systems in the quarter we see thehighest sales ever of our flash purification systems. China accounts for most ofthe growth but we also have hopes to gain market share in other parts of theworld with the recently launched flash purification system Biotage® Selekt andthe associated consumables Biotage® Sfär.We continue to develop our product offering in analytical chemistry, with newproducts, applications and method development. A number of product launches willtake place in analytical chemistry in the coming quarters, systems as well asconsumables.Sales of our Industrial products developed well in the quarter. Not the leastsales of our largest flash purification systems with associated consumables. Acontributing factor is the UV detector that was introduced last year, whichfacilitates the use of these products by the customers.At the start of the year Biotage implemented a new business system. This hasrequired extensive efforts during a longer period of time from many persons inthe organization. We have now established a new platform for further globalcoordination and efficiency.With the positive feeling from the first quarter of the year under our belt weare looking forward to the rest of 2019 with confidence.Coming financial reportsThe interim report for the second quarter 2019 will be published on July 16,2019The interim report for the third quarter 2019 will be published on November 5,2019.The year-end report for 2019 will be published on February 7, 2020.All reports are available at Biotage’s website from the above dates.This report has not been reviewed by the company’s auditors.Uppsala April 24, 2019Torben JörgensenPresident and CEOFor further information, please contact:Torben Jörgensen, President and CEO, phone: +46 707 49 05 84Erika Söderberg Johnson, CFO, phone: +46 707 20 48 20This information is information that Biotage AB (publ) is obliged to make publicpursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Securities Markets Act.

Operating profit (EBIT) afterthe first three months of the year amounted to SEK 141m (73). At the same time,production has started in our initiative for the future, Rottneros Packaging.Good results and continued strong financesSales prices are still high as a weak Swedish krona helps to balance the pricepressure in the market. A very strong result and good cash flow furtherstrengthen our balance sheet and improve our resilience to any uncertainty inthe global economy.Still, we can never stop striving for higher efficiency in all parts of theorganisation. This is a work that is constantly ongoing and can never stop. Itis assuring to know that Rottneros’ employees embrace this thinking andunderstand the value of all of us working as efficiently as possible.As we are dependent on raw material costs and the market's willingness to payfor our products, only one tool really remains that we can directly influence:our own efficiency.Focus on managing disruptionsDespite the good results, it has not been a first quarter completely free fromconcerns. Shortcomings in the quality of the wood raw material causeddisturbances in production, especially at Vallvik Mill.The winter months can be difficult from a raw material point of view, especiallyafter a summer with extreme drought and forest fires. However, it is an areathat we forcefully address on two fronts to minimize in the long run.Firstly, we work with our raw material suppliers to ensure quality. Secondly, weare continuously upgrading our own facilities to reduce sensitivity to anydeficiencies in the raw material. It is an ongoing modernisation that is withinthe scope of our planned annual investments.As a whole, the wood supply is good and winter disturbances have only marginallyaffected production volumes. The cost of raw material has in line with highdemand throughout the Swedish forest industry risen in 2018, but price increaseshave come to an end which is favourable for our business.We have also had some equipment-related disturbances that have held back thepositive development in production. The disturbances also resulted in highermaintenance costs.It is frustrating that we have not been able to increase production when we seethe capacity the plants have when everything runs as it should.A good and safe working environment as well as increased competence are areasthat create the conditions for higher capacity utilisation. Our focus on theseareas contribute to deliberate cost increases.Stable demand with price pressureDemand and price levels for our products remain good even though prices havefallen since the top listing at year-end. This is how we can summarize themarket right now.We have a certain increase in stocks compared to the first quarter of 2018, butthis is less of a concern as the stock level has been in line with that of thefourth quarter of 2018.We can also see a stabilisation in Asia after a long period of decline. We arecautiously optimistic that the stabilisation will be followed by increasingdemand in Asia, which is positive for price development in Europe and NorthAmerica.Full speed ahead for the futureRottneros Packaging has moved into new functional premises in Sunne and hasstarted manufacturing moulded fibre trays for commercial use.In parallel with the construction of the factory, the organisation has beenstrengthened and is now staffed for production in three shifts as well ascontinued development of the business.The investment in Rottneros Packaging is fully in line with our ambition tosatisfy the market demand for products that are smart for the environment andthe climate.I want to thank all my colleagues who have contributed to this extraordinaryquarter. I also want to thank our shareholders, customers, suppliers andlenders.Lennart Eberleh, President and CEO(For full report, please see attached file)This information is information that Rottneros AB is obliged to publish underthe EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Securities Market Act.

Our ambition to achieve a greater degree of industrydiversification is also generating results. The share of the Group’s total salesto industrial and life science customers is now greater than the turnovertowards the automotive industry.Technology and digitization affect everyone, making our work at Semcon morerelevant than ever for more customers and industries. Digitization also createsconsiderable scope for sustainable development. Our commitment to the FossilFree Sweden project through the roadmap for the digitization consultancyindustry is an important initiative, and we initiated a collaboration during thequarter. A number of new strategically important framework agreements weresigned at the beginning of the year, including a framework agreement with theAgency for Digital Government (DIGG). We also co-founded the AI Innovation ofSweden initiative, to accelerate research and innovation in the field.The restructuring of the new Engineering & Digital Services business area wascompleted as planned. The ambition is to become better equipped for rapidtechnology shifts, new customer needs and changing user behaviour. We now havean even stronger platform to develop our digital offering, but also to enhanceour internal potential and efficiency. Adjusted for restructuring costs, thebusiness area’s operating profit is almost on a par with last year. Growth wasimpacted by the ongoing skills shift towards a greater focus on digitalcompetencies. However, growth is expected to gradually increase as theswitchover gains momentum.Digitization also pervades the Product Information business area, which togetherwith new strategically important contracts have contributed to a continuedimprovement in earnings. Customer satisfaction is high and our offering isattractive as it contributes significant value in, for example, the customers’aftermarket business through cost-efficient product information solutions. Weexpect the positive trend to continue in 2019.Operating profit for the second quarter will be affected by non-recurringexpenses related to the restructuring of the Engineering & Digital Servicesbusiness area of approximately SEK 4 million and the quarter contains one fewerworking day compared with the corresponding period last year. The restructuringis expected to have a marginal positive impact on earnings for the full year2019. Total annual savings are expected to amount to some SEK 10 million withfull effect in 2020.We have establish a higher level of profitability and created an excellentfoundation with a strong financial position that offers the right conditions forincreased growth and improved earnings.

Volati AB,2019-04-24 07:45:00,"Q1 January–March 2019  · Net sales increased by 14 percent to SEK 1,544 (1,355) million  · EBITDA increased to SEK 136 (77) million, driven by the introduction of IFRS16  · EBITA amounted to SEK 37 (51) million  · Organic EBITA growth was 8 percent  · Profit after tax amounted to SEK -1 (18) million  · Earnings per ordinary share after deduction of preference share dividendsamounted to SEK -0.21 (0.02)Events after the reporting period  · Volati has acquired all shares in Stenentreprenader i Hessleholm AB andMundus Maskin AB after the end of reporting period. The acquisitions are add-onacquisitions for Volati’s Industry business area and the S:t Eriks and Tornumbusiness units. The acquired companies had combined annual sales of SEK 125million and an EBITDA of SEK 16 million in 2018.COMMENTS FROM THE CEOA good start to the yearVolati showed strong sales growth and good organic EBITA growth in the firstquarter. Just as in previous years, the quarter was affected by seasonalvariations, which were accentuated by our recent acquisitions.This is an interim report that is difficult to analyse. The effects ofseasonality and acquisitions mean that we report 8 percent organic EBITA growth,while EBITA falls from SEK 51 to SEK 37 million. I will explain how these areinterconnected, but let me first of all say that I believe we had a good startto the year. We showed strong sales growth in the first quarter, driven byacquisitions and positive development in several business areas.The first quarter is traditionally the quarter with the lowest sales andearnings for Volati. Although our most recent acquisition S:t Eriks had a verygood quarter, the seasonal variations were further intensified as S:t Eriksnormally reports a negative Q1 operating profit. Calculation of organic EBITAgrowth also takes into account our ownership of S:t Eriks in the comparativeperiod. This means that the company is contributing positively to organicgrowth.EBITA amounted to SEK 37 (51) million. The decline is mainly related to theIndustry business area. We have variations between quarters in our project salesof grain handling systems and in our business unit that rents out water damagerestoration products. These variations are a normal part of our business and wenote that project sales had a good order intake during the quarter and profitrecognition will come later this year than in the previous year.Strong development for TradingThe Trading business area showed very strong development, both in terms of salesand earnings, reporting its best ever Q1. The business area was highlysuccessful in exploiting the good market conditions that continued in thequarter – particularly within builders’ hardware, consumables and material forconstruction.Challenges for ConsumerAs we explained in the year-end report, changes to the inspection rules meanthat the inspection interval has been extended from 12 to 14 months, which hashad an adverse effect on the customer base for the entire vehicle inspectionsector. The effects of the change have come earlier than we initially expected.At the same time, we believe that this may mean a faster return to a normalsituation for us. Given the conditions, Besikta had a quarter that was in linewith expectations and worked hard on efficiency and pricing.We continue to keep close track on other units in the business area. We aremaking progress in the work to reverse the trend, but profitability remainsbelow our expectations.Akademibokhandeln continues positive trendAkademibokhandeln continues to develop positively after the measures weinitiated in the previous year. Q4 2018 saw a trend break that has now beenfollowed by a first quarter in which both sales and earnings have improved. Thecustomer offering is strong and there has been high demand from customers. Atthe same time, the measures taken to streamline operations and reduce costs havecontinued to produce the desired results.Successful work on acquisitionsI see the development in Akademibokhandeln and S:t Eriks as testament to ourability not only to make major acquisitions, but, above all, to our capacity tointegrate acquired companies and deliver on the investment hypotheses on whichthe acquisitions were based. Through our business area organisation, we workclose to the business units, set a strategic direction together with the Boardand management, and ensure that we have the right expertise in the managementgroups and that there is clear monitoring of agreed objectives and targets.Purely and simply, we work together towards the objective of generating long-term value growth.Add-on acquisitions to existing business units are an important part of ourstrategy for long-term value growth creation. They both reinforce the existingbusiness units’ market positions and add further value through synergies. Wehave greater capacity to generate and evaluate potential add-on acquisitionsthan before, as this is largely managed by the business area organisation. Wehave a clear ambition to take advantage of this in the future. After the end ofthe quarter, we completed two add-on acquisitions within the Industry businessarea – Stenentreprenader and Mundus Maskin. The companies will be part S:t Eriksand Tornum and complement their operations very well.Improved financing structureDuring the quarter, we entered into a new loan agreement with Nordea for arevolving credit facility and an overdraft facility. We used part of the amountto finance Akademibokhandeln’s early redemption of its outstanding bonds. Thishas given us an improved overall capital structure, strengthened our capacityfor continued acquisitions and reduced our finance costs by about SEK 15 millionper year. All our credit facilities are structured in such a way that they arenot affected by the introduction of IFRS 16.I am satisfied with the first quarter. We have laid the foundation for a good2019 and I look forward to continuing to build Volati from a position ofstrength.Mårten Andersson, President and CEOConference callCEO Mårten Andersson and CFO Mattias Björk will present the interim report in aconference call on 24 April at 9.00.

When recalculated using the over 25% growth rateof our acquired companies, organic pro forma growth1) totaled 3.2% in thequarter.We see broad growth in nearly every geographic market. In terms of productsegments, we continue to experience solid growth in premium napkins along withvery strong growth in sustainable packaging. The table covers product segmentcontinues to perform negatively.Our most recent acquisitions, BioPak in Australia and New Zealand and Biopac inthe UK, have both continued their positive performance and contributed to higheroverall growth for the quarter.Positive impact of margin programOperating income for the quarter was SEK 93 m (90). Several parts of our ongoingprogram to strengthen margins have already had an impact in the first quarter:1. Price increases due to the high level of pulp prices have gradually had apositive impact in the quarter. They have now largely been implemented accordingto plan.2. As planned, our program to rationalize indirect costs made a positivecontribution to income for the quarter.3. A capacity shortage in the distribution market increased distribution costs.As a result, Q1 did not see any positive net effect of our initiative to improveour logistics flow.High yet falling pulp pricesPulp prices for the first quarter were up 10% compared to the same quarter inthe previous year but have exhibited a slow downward trend. In the secondquarter, Duni’s price compensation in the market will be fully implemented. Ifpulp prices are stable, this will make a positive contribution to income in Q2,”says Johan Sundelin, President and CEO, Duni.1) Currency-adjusted growth including acquired companies, which are comparedwith the previous year’s pro forma figures.::Additional information is provided by:Johan Sundelin, President and CEO, +46 40 10 62 00Mats Lindroth, CFO, +46 40 10 62 00Helena Haglund, Group Accounting Manager, +46 734 19 63 04Duni AB (publ)Box 237SE-201 22 MalmöTel.: +46 40 10 62 00www.duni.com (https://www.duni.com/en)Business registration number: 556536-7488::Duni is a leading supplier of attractive and convenient products for tablesetting and take-away.

This is theresult of our continued investment in marketing, where focus has been inrelation to responsible gambling in Sweden and football sponsorships in the UK.”“As anticipated for several years, the re-regulation of the Swedish marketresulted in significant short term margin pressure, particularly in the firstquarter. The single biggest impact came from all legacy and new Swedishcustomers being awarded with one additional bonus under the terms of the newlicensing system. The significant uptake on customer bonuses, especially inJanuary and February, resulted in bonus expenditure increasing with GBP 6.6million for the first quarter compared with the same period last year.

Resurs Holding AB,2019-04-24 07:30:00,"“Resurs stands strong and continued to grow faster than the market during thequarter and capture market shares.” Kenneth Nilsson, CEO Resurs Holding AB1 January–31 March 2019*  · Lending to the public rose 16% to SEK 29,182 million  · Operating income increased 11% to SEK 896 million  · Operating profit increased 10% to SEK 378 million  · Earnings per share rose 11% to SEK 1.47  · C/I before credit losses (excl. Insurance) was 40.1% (40.7%)  · The credit loss ratio was 2.2% (2.1%)Statement by the CEOThe first three months were characterised by continued robust growth in both ofour banking segments and in four Nordic markets. Our lending rose 16 per cent toSEK 29,182 million, which meets Resurs’s target of total lending growingorganically by over 10 per cent every year by a healthy margin. Operating incomein turn increased 11 per cent to SEK 896 million (806) and the cost/income ratioexcluding Insurance continued to improve to 40.1 per cent (40.7 per cent). Intotal, net profit for the quarter increased 11 per cent to SEK 294 million(265).In other words, Resurs stands strong and continued to grow faster than themarket during the quarter and capture market shares.Performance driven by investments and strategic partnershipsResurs is working to continuously establish strategic partnerships that furtherdrive the development of innovation in payment and financing solutions. Anexample is the commercial partnership that was initiated with fintech companyDicopay during the quarter, in parallel with also becoming a part-owner of thecompany. A strong customer offering is created with Resurs Checkout in Dicopay’smobile platform, primarily targeted to a new customer segment for us thatcomprises small businesses that require simple and fast invoicing of servicesrendered.Resurs was one of the first to offer its Swedish customers the option ofreceiving post via Kivra’s digital mailbox. We further strengthened ourpartnership in the first quarter by investing in Kivra’s new Finnish jointventure. By joining forces with Kivra, we can jointly drive digitisation in theFinnish market while at the same time strengthening our commercial offering. Thedigital transformation also helps reduce paper consumption and is thus animportant part of Resurs’s long-term sustainability efforts.Intense activities to meet a new market situation in the Norwegian consumer loanmarketPayment Solutions and mainly retail finance, which are the core of our businessmodel, continued to stand out in the market during the quarter, with a strongperformance in both growth and higher margins. A fundamental strength ofResurs’s business model is its ability to balance and compensate the businesssegments for changing conditions in the four Nordic markets. In Consumer Loansin Norway, we believe that all players have now adapted their offering to thenew regulations that were introduced about a year ago. The intended and expectedeffects of the rules were also clearly seen during the quarter with a sharpincrease in competition for the volumes remaining in the wake of feweropportunities to grant consumer credit loans. Intensified competition has led todownward pressure on interest margins, and to meet this we will introduce anumber of initiatives and measures in the second quarter. Our assessment is thatthese measures, combined with our well-proven business model will give us theperseverance required to defend a continued strong position in the Norwegianconsumer loan market. At the same time, we will focus on increasing the rate ofgrowth in our other markets, which shows the strength of our Nordic businessmodel.All in all, this led to a negative impact on the Group’s risk-adjusted NBImargin, which was 9.6 per cent (10.4 per cent) for the first quarter. The lowermargin was mainly the effect of the new conditions in the Norwegian consumerloan market. We otherwise delivered on or over our financial targets, whichResurs has done every quarter without exception since it was listed.In-depth experience and cutting-edge digital developmentWith more than 40 years of experience in the consumer credit market, we knowthat the profitable way forward involves making continuous adjustments to alignwith new conditions, customer behaviour patterns and terms. Our robust businessmodel and cutting-edge digital development give us a stable platform for our day-to-day work of improving and developing new, innovative payment and financingsolutions that create value for us as well as for our many retail financepartners and customers. We confidently look forward to continued healthy andprofitable growth for Resurs’s business in all Nordic markets.Kenneth NilssonCEO Resurs Holding ABMore information is available from:Peter Rosén, CFO & Head of IR, peter.rosen@resurs.se +46 736 56 49 34Sofie Tarring Lindell, IR Officer,sofie.tarringlindell@resurs.se (gunilla.wikman@resurs.se) +46 736 44 33 95About Resurs:Resurs Holding (Resurs), which operates through the subsidiaries Resurs Bank andSolid Försäkring, is the leader in retail finance in the Nordic region, offeringpayment solutions, consumer loans and niche insurance products.

This business unit was consolidatedinto Enea effective 1 March, with operations then integrated into the NetworkSolutions pro­duct group.  · On 8 January, Enea announced the appointment of Jan Häglund as its new CEO.Jan will take up his position at Enea’s AGM on 6 May 2019.January - March 2019(First quarter previous year in brackets)  · Revenue, SEK 240.9 (170.3) million  · Revenue growth, 41 (19) %  · Revenue growth, currency adjusted, 34 (21) %  · Operating profit excluding non-recurring items, SEK 65.7 (35.1) million  · Operating profit, SEK 62.2 (27.0) million  · Operating margin excluding non-recurring items, 27.3 (20.6) %  · Operating margin, 25.8 (15.9) %  · Net profit after tax, SEK 41.4 (18.2) million  · Earnings per share, SEK 2.14 (0.94)  · Cash flow (from operating activities), SEK 93.3 (8.0) million  · Cash and cash equivalents and financial investments, SEK 142.7 (140.6)millionAnders Lidbeck, President and CEO comments:New year, new recordsThe first quarter was a strong start to 2019. Revenue was up by as much as 41percent on the first quarter 2018, with operating profit up by a fantastic 130percent on the first quarter one year previously. Opera­ting profit before non-recurring items increased by all of 87 percent year over year. To bring someperspective to these numbers, it’s worth remembering that when we presented ouroperating profit before non-recurring items a year ago, this was the best first-quarter opera­ting profit in Enea’s history. Earnings per share set another newrecord for a first quarter, and we were able to report EPS of over SEK 2 for thesecond consecutive quarter. But we should note that in the quarter, we reached asettlement that provided us with SEK 20 m of revenue. We were in a long-termdispute with one of our major customers on histo­rical royalty payments. Aspreviously reported, most of this dispute was settled by in an arbitrationprocedure in January 2018. The arbitration agreement concluded all outstandingissues in this protracted dispute. This enables us to look forward, and focus onrebuilding trust and en­deavoring to create new partnerships in attractivesegments with this customer.In the first quarter, we were also able to complete the acquisition of abusiness unit from Atos Convergence Creators, as we announced late last year.This operation was integrated as a new business unit in the quarter, focusing onpolicy management, authentication and access management within Enea’sorganization, and we’ve added new sales and development offices in Austria,Germany and Croatia. This new acquisition offers Enea new potential to addressfourth and fifth-gene­ration mobile core networks. These operations wereconsolidated into Enea’s accounts effective March of the past quarter, and arealready ma­king a positive contribution to our EPS.Our global software business grew very robustly overall in the first quarter ofthe year, increasing by 75 percent year over year. Sales in the segment wedesignate Network Solutions, which will also include the recently acquiredoperation, grew by a total of 95 percent overall on the corresponding quarter ofthe previous year. Our Operating Sys­tem Solutions business also grew by 15percent on the corresponding quarter of the previous year. In this latter case,growth was driven by the above conciliation settlement. It bears repeating thatwe should be aware that our traditional business on Key Accounts is contractingwith more widespread use of open source. This underlying trend is un­changed.The first quarter of the year is usually eventful, and the past quarter was noexception. The Mobile World Congress was held in Barcelona at the end ofFebruary, and as usual, was the largest convention for the whole industry weoperate in. As previously, Enea was an exhibitor, with a larger stand andgreater presence than ever before. This year, we were able to present the ‘new’Enea including Openwave Mobility, and our recently acquired business unit inpolicy and access management also participated under Enea’s banner and branding.We also started the year by announcing some of the largest single deals we havemade for some time, including major new deals in traffic management and the DPIsegment. We also received several new awards in this latter segment, with ournew Qosmos Probe product winning the gold med­al in ISPG’s Excellence Awards,and Cyber Defense magazine’s InfoSec Awards, as winner of the Most InnovativeProduct in the cyber forensics category, as well as winner of Most Cutting EdgeProduct in the threat hunting category. We are continuing our work on developingour posi­tioning in cyber security, and in the past quarter, also participatedas an exhibitor at RSA—the largest conference and trade fair in the securitysegment.New times and a new EneaThe Enea that’s now taking shape is a completely different company to the Enea Itook over as CEO of in 2011. Over the past eight years, we have evolved frombeing a player in services and embedded opera­ting systems with a major regionalfocus on the Nordics, to becoming a global player in software fortelecommunication and software com­ponents for cyber security. We’ve createdunprecedented profitability within the company and embarked on a journey ofgrowth that has taken us from the stock market’s Small Cap to Mid Cap list, tonow con­verging on yearly revenue of SEK 1 billion. I now see a company withevery prospect of continuing to develop its market positioning and set newrecords in terms of revenue, profitability and cash flow. Obviously, our 600-plus professionals worldwide, who work every day to build a bigger, strongerand more successful Enea, are the foundation of this fantastic progress. It’sbeen a privilege to serve as CEO of these out­standing people, and I offer youmy humble thanks for your trust in me. When I depart as CEO in a few weeks’time, I do so with the confident conviction that Enea has a bright future ahead,with Jan Häglund as its new CEO, leading Enea to new successes.Future prospectsIt’s also worth repeating that while shareholders should be pleased aboutanother very strong quarter, we also need to be aware that our business doesvary between quarters, that these variations increase with the acquisitions wehave executed in recent years. Acquisitions that strengthen our market positionand long-term earnings capacity are an important part of our strategy. It isalso this strategy that enables us, despite decreasing revenues from KeyAccounts, to maintain our ambition to keep growing the company with goodprofitability and healthy cash flows.Our objective for the full year 2019 is to achieve revenue growth over 2018 andan operating margin exceeding 20 percent.Press and analyst meetingPress and financial analysts are invited to a press and analyst meeting whereAnders Lidbeck, President and CEO, will present and comment on the report.Time: Wednesday April 24 at 08:30 am CET.Link: https://financialhearings.com/event/11500Phone number: SE: +46850558355, UK: +443333009262The full report is published on www.enea.comThis information is information that Enea AB (publ) is obliged to make publicpursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

We have continued to take market shares andachieved an all-time-high for quarterly earnings, with EBIT of 11.3%, which isthe highest level of profitability in Elos Medtech’s history. This is becauseall units now contribute to the good development.Our efforts with Operational Excellence and lower scrap costs have continuedwith very good results. We’ve significantly reduced the volume of scrapedmaterials, which has a direct positive impact on our earnings.The transfer to Bruel & Kjaer has progressed in accordance with plan. Theinventory has now been sold and during the next quarter, all production will bemoved there as well.In line with our plans to develop more proprietary products, we’ve had a patentapproved by the US Patent and Trademark Office. The patent covers a drillingsystem that is used during implant surgery, leading to greater precision thatrequires fewer instruments. We’ve also benefited from EU funding for research onwhite titanium surfaces in our efforts to develop proprietary products. Receiptof the grant is confirmation of our high competence as well.With rapid growth, there is a need to recruit new employees. So, to meetcustomer requirements on delivery, above all in USA, we will focus our effortson this quite a bit in the near future.We’ve started an exciting journey that involves comprehensive changes to takeElos Medtech to the next level. We have our sights on higher profitability,which we feel is attainable due to the positive trend in orthopedics(particularly robotic surgery), expanded production capacity, bettercoordination of our global units and investments in attractive segments.

Excluding impact of IFRS 16,Result per share increased to SEK 0.19 SEK (0.18)CEO commentsWe have started the year with GHP’s best first quarter so far and once again wehave a quarter with good organic growth. We have a strong culture of continuousdevelopment, with good momentum in each individual clinic. This is thefoundation of the good quality and financial results. Furthermore, it attractsnew employees and results in good growth.When we have a good underlying business, it also creates scope for developmentand new initiatives. During the quarter we opened our new orthopaedic clinic atGärdet in Stockholm. This is an initiative that initially entails some start-upcosts, but it will make a positive contribution over time and will beappreciated by both our customers and our patients.Our Nordic region segment continued to grow in the period and our revenuesincreased in all the submarkets of the segment. As we can see that the demandfor high-quality specialist care continues to increase, we have continued tocreate more capacity at our clinics. In March yet another operating theatre wascompleted in Copenhagen and we managed to recruit more skilled specialists forour clinics during the first quarter. Another important area for our financialdevelopment is that choice of care and procurement processes are reasonablydesigned and encourage sound behaviour. Here we are actively working onsupporting the development of structures through dialogue with the purchasers.This is long-term work but we have already seen that we can make a difference byfocusing on this question.Our International segment had an eventful quarter. Development of the fourhospitals in the UAE continued in a positive direction, where the health carestaff in the hospitals each day do important work to improve care and look afterpatients well. Our remuneration in the UAE is impacted amongst other things byin what quarter certain defined activities are carried out, which means thatrevenues can vary from quarter to quarter. During the first quarter there weresomewhat fewer activities, which is also reflected in the revenues and resultsfor the quarter. This means that later on in the year we will carry out all themore activities.During the first few months of the year we have spent time explaining why it isso important that GHP is present in the United Arab Emirates. During the twoyears or so that we have run the hospitals we have been able, together with theauthorities, to considerably develop the hospital care provided. For example,considerably more of the serious trauma cases that come to A&E survive and wehave introduced modern obstetric care. For each and every one of theapproximately 250,000 patients that seek care at the hospitals each year, GHP’spresence has only had a positive effect.There is a great unmet need for health care in the region and we are convincedthat GHP is in a good position to meet this need. We have therefore continued toconcentrate on business development during the first quarter. Our businessdevelopment team is focusing on securing new management contracts in the MiddleEast during 2019.GHP’s third segment, Vårdsamverkan, continued to work during the quarter onhelping insurance companies to offer patients an effective encounter with healthcare that is clearly coupled to high quality outcomes. We now have an efficientmodel where our way of working creates value for patients, insurance companiesand GHP. Vårdsamverkan functions as an independent business of its own where wepurchase care from both GHP’s own clinics and external clinics. During the firstquarter we established tools to be able to further analyse and optimise carechains in a structured manner and we are constantly developing our digitaloffering so as to be able to meet insurance companies’ and patients’ needs.It is now crucial that we continue to develop our segments to ensure that werealise the great potential which exists in each and every one of them and whichcreates a really strong whole.23 April 2019GothenburgGHP Specialty Care AB (publ)The BoardQueries should be addressed to:Daniel Öhman, CEO, Tel: +46 708 55 37 07Philip Delborn, CFO, Tel: +46 702 12 52 64GHP is an internationally active health care provider that operates specialistclinics in a select number of diagnostic areas through the application of abusiness model that is unique in the health care industry, where leading doctorsand medical staff become partners and shareholders.

Moment Group AB,2019-04-18 07:30:00,"The quarter was burdened by 2Entertain and Kungsportshuset. Stable revenues fromimplemented acquisitions are important for the Group. Group-wide actionprogrammes are in progress. Resolution passed on a fully guaranteed rights issueto boost the financial position moving forward.                         2019       2019        2018(SEK million)            Jan–Mar    Jan–Mars    Jan–Mar                         IFRS 16    IAS 17      IAS 17Net sales                217        217         277Pro rata sales           175        175         233Operating profit/loss    -3         -16         5before depreciations(EBITDA)Operating profit/loss    -20        -21         1(EBIT)Operating margin         -9%        -10%        0%Operating margin, pro    -11%       -12%        1%rataEarnings per share       -1.55      -1.34       0.01A WORD FROM THE CEOThe year’s first quarter was characterized by 2Entertain’s negative sales trendsfor the current 2018/19 season, and the challenges involved in reachingprofitability in Wallmans Group’s investment in Kungsportshuset in Gothenburg.This resulted in a marked reduction in sales and earnings compared to the sameperiod for the previous year. Sales amounted to SEK 217 million (277), andprofit/loss recalculated according to the earlier accounting policies amountedto SEK -20 million (1), where 2Entertain and Wallmans Group account for equalparts of the negative performance. Other business areas developed in line withexpectations. Immersive Experiences delivered a strong first-quarter while Eventwas weaker than in previous years, but it had long been known that Hansen wouldnot do any volume business during the period with the same calibre as the VolvoOcean Race.2Entertain is taking steps to ensure positive development moving forward.Because 2Entertain’s business model is based on productions in project form,comprehensive efforts are in progress to minimize future risk in the portfolioand to reduce the weight of fixed costs in the company. A number of thesemeasures were announced during the quarter:  ·  Investments in Germany under own auspices discontinued. In the future,2Entertain will instead collaborate with BB Promotion, which entailssignificantly lower risk. During the quarter, 2Entertain was charged with SEK -3million in this regard, which is in line with earlier announcements.  ·  Action programmes to reduce fixed costs. The program is aimed at reducingthe costs of premises and personnel to provide a total annual saving of SEK 6million. This is equivalent to 14% of 2Entertain’s fixed costs, and the savingswill be implemented gradually during 2019/20.  ·  Updated risk assessment model. The model is aimed at reducing risk-takingin future musical, theatre and show productions. In addition to the types ofproductions that will be performed, the model also addresses break-even levelsand 2Entertain’s equity interest in various productions.The above measures provide conditions for a gradual recovery of 2Entertain’searnings during the year, especially since it is meeting, at the time ofwriting, its sales prognoses for upcoming productions in the summer and autumnof 2019.Stable trends in established arenas in Wallmans Group, but burdened byKungsportshusetThe established arenas in Wallmans Group performed in line with the previousyear, with the exception of Wallmans Oslo, which improved its earnings by SEK 3million. During the quarter, Kungsportshuset lost a further SEK 3 millioncompared to the previous year. A thorough evaluation of the Kungsportshusetoperation is underway in the business area along with associated measures aimedat successively reducing the impact on earnings during the year, and drawingbenefit from expertise within Wallmans Group regarding the business models,concepts and operational organisations of established arenas.Stable revenues from implemented acquisitions play an important part in theGroupMoment Group’s investment in establishing itself in new segments in theexperience industry has been crucial for developing the Group’s earnings.Through the acquisitions of STAR, Ballbreaker and Minnesota, the Group addedEBIT earnings of SEK 5.5 million (2.2) in the first quarter, equivalent to EBITSEK 24 million on a rolling full-year basis. These acquisitions were carried outat a total operational evaluation of SEK 127 million, which corresponds to anEBIT multiple of 5.3. All of these operations are also characterized by cashflows evenly distributed throughout the annual cycle. These companies thusconstitute a significant part of the Group’s operations today.The Group’s current action programme to reduce the weight of costs by around SEK20 millionThere is currently a group-wide action programme aimed at reducing fixed costsby SEK 20 million on an annual basis, including the above mentioned actionprogramme in 2Entertain. It involves merging and streamlining shared functions,not replacing a number of positions due to natural wastage, and reducing officespace within the Group.The decision to implement a fully guaranteed rights emissionFinancial trends for 2Entertain over recent quarters, the investment inKungsportshuset with its associated operating loss and the final payment for theacquisition of Minnesota Communication have placed a strain on the consolidatedbalance sheet. Accordingly, after the end of the quarter, the Board resolved tocarry out a fully guaranteed rights issue that will provide the company witharound SEK 55 million aimed at strengthening the company’s financial positionand further developing the operation. Together, these measures will createconditions for returning the Group to profitability and continuing to realizethe full potential of our operations.Gothenburg, 18 April 2019Pelle MattissonCEO/Group CEOpelle.mattisson@momentgroup.com+46 705 80 06 57This disclosure comprises information that Moment Group AB is obliged todisclose according to the EU market abuse regulation.

Beijer Electronics Group AB,2019-04-17 13:00:00,"  · Order intake amounted to 369 MSEK (398).  · Net sales increased by 10% to 371 MSEK (337).  · EBIT up to 30.1 MSEK (18.1).  · Profit after tax increased to 20.0 MSEK (9.6).  · Earnings per share were 0.70 SEK (0.34).Comments from CEO Per Samuelsson“BEIJER GROUP consolidated its positive trend with continued healthy organicgrowth and a sharp improvement to earnings in the first quarter. Sales rose by10%, and EBIT by nearly 70%. This means an EBIT margin of over 8%, and thatwe’re gradually converging on the Group’s 10% target.The earnings increase is backed by higher sales volumes and continued expansionof our gross margin. It is mainly our new products–the results of ourinitiatives in recent years–that are providing the increasing volumes. Thehigher gross margins are due to previous efficiency improvement and a betterproduct mix.Meanwhile, EBIT was charged with higher overheads, resulting in measuresincluding more initiatives in the Westermo business entity, as announced in ourfourthquarter Report. In the short-term, they impact earnings, but we view themas investments in continued high growth and capacity expansion, and eventually,higher margins.Order intake is favorable, given that the period did not include any majororder, unlike the corresponding period of 2018. Adjusted for these orders, orderintake made positive progress in the quarter. Order intake was also impacted byphase-outs of old products, which creates some irregularity between quarters.Meanwhile, our order book was 36% larger at the end of the quarter than at thesame point of 2018, and we’re not seeing any immediate cyclical slowdown on ourmarkets.Once again, the Beijer Electronics business entity provided strong earningsgains. Growth is positive, and the business entity’s continued expansion is animportant component of the Group’s long-term value creation. The Westermobusiness entity achieved a rapid recovery of EBIT margins after progressivelypoorer quarters in the latter part of 2018. Actions to relieve the capacityshortage and additional expenses have started to take their intended effect.Meanwhile, capacity has been expanded further to address continued high growth.The Korenix business entity had a somewhat poorer first quarter, butsignificantly better than the fourth quarter 2018. The business entity hascontinued to build out and improve its product portfolio, which we expect toattract forthcoming orders and sales. We are retaining our plan of Korenixachieving continued growth and achieving profitability in 2019.For the full year 2019, we think the Group will still be able to increase salesand earnings compared to the figures for 2018.”Invitation to conference callToday, a conference call will be held for press and analysts, where Presidentand CEO Per Samuelsson and EVP and CFO Joakim Laurén present the company andcomment on the report.Time:  Wednesday April 17, at 14.00 CESTTo participate in the conference please dial:From SE: +46850558352From UK: +443333009260To access the presentation please use this link:https://www.anywhereconference.com?Conference=301284909&PIN=40835628&UserAudioMod e=DATAThe report and the presentation will be available at Beijer Electronics Group’swebsite www.beijergroup.com.

Strong salesperformance combined with positive effects from currencies and renegotiated long-term contracts increased net sales by 10% in the quarter, which is well aboveour financial target of 3-4%.I am very pleased to announce that the ramp-up of KM7 at Gruvön is proceedingaccording to plan and test-runs of the machine are now ongoing. This 550,000tonnes board machine is one of the most modern production facilities in theworld and makes BillerudKorsnäs well positioned to meet the increasing demandfor sustainable packaging solutions. We reiterate that the structural changes inconnection to the ramp-up of KM7 will have a negative effect on EBITDA ofapproximately SEK 500 million during 2019 and SEK 200 million during 2020.Following this short-term impact, the investment will have a positive earningscontribution from 2021.A comprehensive safety programme based on best practise has been launched andthe entire company is now working to prevent accidents and eliminate risks witha zero injury vision in mind. I truly believe that a safe company is a well-runcompany. Therefore, our safety-first initiative, together with the productionexcellence programme are the main focus areas for BillerudKorsnäs. On the backof this, we see good opportunities to increase production stability and volumesin 2019 compared with last year.To secure long-term competitive and stable wood supply we have entered into anagreement to acquire Bergvik Skog Öst. The transaction is expected to becompleted during the second quarter and the process to find suitable investorsfor a substantial part of the forestland is ongoing.We have announced that a joint venture will be formed with plastic packagingsolutions provider ALPLA. The two companies share the ambition to drivepackaging innovation in a sustainable direction. With combined resources, wewill continue the development of the paper bottle with the aim of launching theproduct and then scaling up production.For the second quarter, our assessment is continued good demand for our productsand we foresee our order books to remain solid. However we expect price pressureto increase and are focusing on safeguarding current price levels. We expectunchanged market demand for pulpwood and the total cost of fibre to flatten outat a high level.In the longer term, market trends offer significant opportunities for continuedgrowth. We are well positioned with a broad offering of innovative andsustainable packaging and solutions. Demand for a comprehensive offering, inwhich the sustainability of materials plays a key role, is growing. Packaging isgaining an increasingly important role in many brand owners’ efforts to maketheir products more competitive. This continues to give us great confidence inour products and development.Our strategy is based on achieving sustainable profitable growth by challengingconventional packaging materials and solutions. To unlock BillerudKorsnäs fullpotential we have an agenda that focuses on safety, securing the successful ramp-up of KM7, safeguarding wood supply, stabilising production, enhancingefficiency and accelerating innovation and solutions.With our new organisation in place, we see positive effects in operationalefficiency, customer orientation and profitability focus. We are well preparedto capture customer demand and expand in the value-chain.Petra Einarsson, President and CEOSALES AND RESULTSNet sales for the first quarter increased by 10% to SEK 6 504 million (5 897),as a result of higher sales prices and positive currency effects. The salesvolumes were largely unchanged.All divisions delivered growth, on or above 10 %, mainly driven by higher salesprices and positive currency effects.Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 6% to SEK 1 035 million (1 102). Higher costs forraw materials and energy as well as a negative impact from lost productionvolumes at Gävle and a changed product mix at Gruvön were partly offset byincreased sales.The implementation of IFRS16 affected adjusted EBITDA positively by SEK 27million in the first quarter, see note 1. Items affecting comparability,amounting to SEK 13 million (37) and reported in Other, was mainly related toGruvön and KM7.MARKET DEVELOPMENT AND OUTLOOKMarket conditions for liquid packaging board, cartonboard and containerboardwere good in the quarter. Conditions are expected to remain good with normalseasonal variations except for uncoated liner, for which the market is moreunstable and price pressure is expected to increase.The market for sack and kraft paper was good during the quarter but has weakenedcompared with the same period last year. The pulp market has weakened due to theslowdown in the Chinese market. The market pulp price index (PIX) has droppedfrom USD 1 200 at year-end 2018 to USD 1 105 at the end of March 2019.For further information, please contact:Christopher Casselblad, EVP Communication & Sustainability, +46 8 553 335 08Lena Schattauer, Investor Relations, +46 8 553 335 10This information constituted inside information prior to publication.

Beijer Ref AB,2019-04-16 08:30:03,"Continued strong developmentNet Sales increased by 32 per cent in the first quarter compared to the sameperiod last year and amounted to SEK 3,434 million (2,605). Organic growth was8%.The operating profit for the quarter amounted to SEK 244 million (172), anincrease of 42% compared with the same period last year. The operating marginwas 7.1% (6.6%), of which 0.2% is a positive IFRS 16 effect.Profit for the period totalled SEK 170 million (121). Profit per share totalledSEK 1.33 (0.92).With effect from 1 January 2019, the company applies IFRS 16 with regard to thegroup's leasing agreements and all figures for 2019 include this change. Theconversion affected operating profit positively by SEK 7 million and net profitby SEK 1 million. The equity ratio has decreased by 4 percentage points due tothe increased balance sheet total.As of 2 January 2019, the Beijer Ref share is being traded on Nasdaq Stockholm'sLarge Cap.Comments by the CEOThe acquisitions deliverThe first quarter of 2019 lived up to the targets we had set. In total, netsales amounted to SEK 3.4 billion (2.6 billion), an increase of 32%, of which 20per cent is from acquisitions and 8 per cent is an organic increase in sales.Operating margin, including the effect of IFRS 16, amounted to 7.1% (6.6%),which is higher than the corresponding period last year, in spite of fallingprices for refrigerants.All regions show growth. It is particularly positive to see that the majoracquisitions in the southern hemisphere that were conducted in 2018, TecsaRecoin South Africa and Heatcraft in Australia, both contribute to our profits andalso equalise seasonal variations. We are following developments in SouthAfrica, which has been in recession for some years. Certain signs suggest thatthe country is moving towards GDP growth again, although other factors such asthe forthcoming national elections may have effects.All of the group's market segments is growing and in the first quarter the areaof commercial refrigeration represents 54% of Beijer Ref’s sales. Airconditioning, HVAC, is growing by two-digit numbers and now accounts for about36% of the group's sales. Prices of refrigerants continue to decline but theystill remain at high levels. One effect of this is that the refrigerants' shareof our total sales is more and more returning to normal. We are well preparedfor the progressively changing market conditions, for which we have compensatedwith increasing sales of our sustainable product range. The significance for thegroup of the price trend for refrigerants has therefore gradually declined. Thegeneral market assessment is that prices may become stabilised during Q2 andthen possibly rise slightly in the autumn.Conversion to sustainable solutions continues to drive demand for ourenvironmentally friendly technology. The permitted quantity of CO2 equivalentsis restricted even more tightly for 2021. This generates increased pressure onthe market to adapt to the new rules and we see a steadily arising awareness ofthis when we meet our customers. As a result, increased orders have been goodfor the company's OEM range. We continuously look at how we can expand our ownproduction capacity, which is a requirement for being able to meet the expectedfuture demand for sustainable refrigeration installations.Interest in the market for environmentally friendly refrigerants is great, andwe see it as our task and our responsibility to inform and educate customers andpartners in how to handle such refrigerants. Our training programme ""Beijer RefAcademy"", which we launched last year in Italy, has been a success. We will besetting up similar programmes in more countries during 2019.We continue to work on digitalisation and have launched an e-commerce platformin Germany, the United Kingdom and Switzerland, among others. We will launch e-commerce in a number of other markets during the year.Beijer Ref is now a well-known market leader, not only in Europe but also onother continents. As a natural consequence, we are spreading our name to agreater extent, so that some of our subsidiaries are successively changing theirnames to Beijer Ref. The latest in the line is our Indian company, which fromMarch this year is called Beijer Ref India. Also new is that we have taken aglobal approach to certain products and components by creating a dedicatedproduct series, which will be launched later in the year.One date that stands out during the quarter was 2 January, when our share movedup onto Nasdaq's Large Cap list. This was a milestone in the group's history andthe list change has been an objective. This is proof that our long-term globalstrategy is working.The quarter did not contain any new acquisitions, but we are continuouslyevaluating a number of opportunities. Liquidity is good and cash flow has beenpositive during the quarter.Conditions for the second quarter are favourable and we are following ourexpressed strategy so as to create further profitable growth. The team spirit inthe group is strong. This provides the conditions for being able to continue todeliver good returns for our shareholders.Per Bertland, CEOFirst quarter of 2019NET SALESBeijer Ref increased sales by 32 per cent to SEK 3,434 million (2,605) duringthe first quarter of 2019, 20% of which is explained by the acquisitions madeduring 2018, which have a high season during the winter months, as well asgenerally favourable economic conditions in the company's other markets. Allregions show growth in net sales. Adjusted for exchange rate changes andacquisitions, organic growth in net sales was 8 per cent. A weakened Swedishkrona resulted in positive currency effects of SEK 104 million, corresponding to4%, since most of the company’s sales are in currencies other than Swedishkronor.PROFITThe Group’s operating profit totalled SEK 244 million (172) during the firstquarter, which is an increase of 42 per cent. The operating margin was 7.1%(6.6%), in spite of falling refrigerant prices.The profit before tax was SEK 228 million (167). Profit for the period was SEK170 million (121). Profit per share totalled SEK 1.33 (0.92).CASH FLOWCash flow from operating activities before change in working capital was SEK 278million in 2019 compared with SEK 153 million for 2018. The increase is due toimproved profit during the quarter and a positive effect of SEK 71 millionrelated to depreciation of rights of use assets arising from the transition tothe IFRS 16 (lease). The corresponding amount of SEK 71 million is reported as adecrease in the financing operations.Working capital increased by SEK 42 million during the quarter compared with SEK112 million the previous year. This gives cash flow from operating activities ofSEK 236 million, compared with SEK 41 million the previous year. The change inworking capital between the years is mainly due to a smaller build-up of stocksduring the quarter.At the end of the period, the company had unutilised credit facilities totallingSEK 1,588 million (205).INVESTMENTSThe Group’s investments in fixed assets including business combinations totalledSEK 27 million (349) during the first quarter and relate primarily toinvestments in fixed assets. In the previous year, TecsaReco was acquired duringthe quarter.COMPANY ACQUISITIONSNo acquisitions were made during the quarter, but the company is continuouslyevaluating new opportunities for growth and complementary acquisitions.In the first quarter of 2018, the acquisition of the wholesale company TecsaRecoin South Africa was completed. The company has annual sales of SEK 450 millionwith 300 employees across 23 branches. The company is included in theconsolidated accounts with effect from 1 March 2018.SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE QUARTERAs of 2 January 2019, the Beijer Ref share is being traded on Nasdaq Stockholm'sLarge Cap.RISK DESCRIPTIONThe Beijer Ref Group’s operations are subject to a number of businessenvironment factors, the effects of which on the Group’s operating profit can becontrolled to varying degrees.

Where necessary,measures are taken to reduce the Group’s risk exposure. In its operations,Beijer Ref is subject to financial risks such as currency risk, interest raterisk and liquidity risk.

Salesdeveloped well both in stores and online in many markets, including Sweden whichgrew by 11 percent, the UK by 8 percent, Poland by 15 percent, China by 16percent and India by 42 percent in local currencies.In the first quarter the group’s sales increased by 10 percent, which in localcurrencies represents a sales increase of 4 percent.During the quarter the company successfully transitioned the online platform inGermany. One of the measures to ensure a smooth, well-executed transition was todeliberately hold back on sales activities in Germany, which had a dampeningeffect on online sales. Adjusted for Germany’s online sales, the group’s totalnet sales increase was 6 percent in local currencies.All markets are now on the new online platform. For our customers in the Germanmarket this means improvements such as faster and more flexible deliveries, andbetter integration between our physical stores and the online store.The quarter’s pre-tax profit of SEK 1,043 m was negatively affected by the dropin sales in Germany, but also by costs of around SEK 250 m associated mainlywith the replacement of the online platform in Germany as well as continuedcosts relating to implemented and upcoming transitions to new logistics systems.This is having a negative effect on our margin in the short term but will have apositive effect in the longer term as it will result in a faster, more flexibleand more efficient product flow.We can see that our transformation work is having an effect and we will continuethis work at full speed within our strategic focus areas:Create the best customer offeringProduct assortment – secure the best combination of fashion, quality, price andsustainability for all the brands.Physical stores – continued development of new concepts and optimisation of thestore portfolio.Online stores – improvements such as faster and more flexible delivery optionsand payments.Continued integration of our physical stores and online stores to enhance thecustomer experience.Fast, efficient and flexible product flowThe supply chain will be even faster, more flexible and more efficient.Initiatives within advanced data analytics and AI.Investments in infrastructure – our tech foundationContinued investments in our tech foundation including robust scalable platformsthat enable faster development of various customer apps and new technologies.Adding growthDigital expansion into new markets.

Thedecision is part of the CO100+ action programme, which is expected to reduce thecompany’s annual costs by 200-250 MSEK, with full effect from the 2020/21financial year  · Growth in Q3 better than market, but lower than internal target – affectsprofitability for the current year. The operating margin for full-year 2018/2019is expected to be approximately 3%* and the underlying operating marginapproximately 5%CEO’s CommentGrowing both in store and online in a challenging marketIncreased underlying operating profit and solid growth in tough marketFor the first time in many years, the market did not grow during Christmastrading this year in Sweden, Norway or Finland. Instead, it was lower than inthe preceding year and did not match the forecasts made. A clear pattern wasalso that Christmas trading had a strong start during “Black week,” which wasfollowed by a weak period, before having a very strong final spurt. Online wasthe sales channel that continued to grow in the market as a whole.In terms of sales and earnings, the third quarter is the most important for us.We made preparations in the form of attractive customer offerings, increaseddigital capacity and more and better online delivery options. These initiativesproduced results. Growth outperformed the market, but was lower than internaltarget. Organic growth was 4 per cent for the quarter and organic growth for thenine-month period was in line with the target of 5 per cent. During the quarter,online sales increased by 51 per cent, compared with the year-earlier period.We also maintained the gross margin of 40.4 per cent (40.8) for the quarter. Intotal, this yielded in an underlying operating profit of 363 MSEK (359), whichis somewhat higher than in the preceding year.Cash flow from operating activities strengthened during the quarter, mainlydriven by systematic inventory control, but also by healthy sales and asustained gross margin. In addition, the inventory value, 1,983 MSEK (1,880) atthe end of the quarter, is again at a favourable level after the planned build-up of inventory that was implemented in the first quarter in connection withthe implementation of the sCORE business system.Clas Ohlson is growing both in stores and online in a challenging marketclimate. However, sales in the quarter did not reach our internal target andthat affects profitability for the current year. The operating margin for full-year 2018/2019 is expected to be approximately 3%* and the underlying operatingmargin approximately 5%.Closure of the store network in the UK and Germany proceeding to planThe work to concentrate the store network to the Nordic home market, and therebyclose our stores in the UK and Germany and focus on online, is proceedingaccording to plan. The discontinuation cost has now been booked to 210 MSEK andis charged to earnings for the quarter. The aim is for the process to becompleted during the current financial year and that the anticipated positiveearnings effect of approximately 75 MSEK per year will have full impact afterthe second quarter of 2019/20.Full focus on lower costsThe systematic work to reduce costs as part of the CO100+ action programme iscontinuing. The decision to conduct an organisational review to reduce costs andcreate a more efficient and flexible organisation was announced at the beginningof February. A total of 150-200 positions are expected to be affected.During the quarter, the work also intensified to reduce purchasing and suppliercosts and we continued to work on optimising our product range in store.The costs of the CO100+ action programme are also expected to remain in therange announced of 1-2 per cent of the underlying operating margin.Continuing our initiatives for long-term growthProjects within CO100+ to create long-term growth are proceeding to plan. One ofthe most important milestones is to double our online sales every second year.Succeeding at this requires smart solutions for delivery to customers. Oneexample of this is the Click & Collect solution that had something of abreakthrough during Christmas trading, when one in three customers chose to havetheir online order delivered to a store. This delivery solution also contributesto promoting footfall in stores.Another example is our partnership with MatHem, which is contributing in atangible way to enabling us to grow our online business in a cost-effectivemanner, at the same time as we are making everyday life simpler for ourcustomers. The partnership with MatHem developed well during the quarter. It wasalso announced in February that Kinnevik would become the new principal owner ofMatHem after making a major investment in the company. This step furtherstrengthens MatHem, both for us as an important partner and as a financialinvestment.Long-term profitable growth according to planThe change in the retail sector is proceeding in the direction we predicted andhave built the strategy to address. The trend is now moving faster thanexpected. This means that I am even more convinced that we are on the right pathin our adjustment work. We implemented a number of significant measures duringthe quarter and are now on schedule with the planned measures under theframework of CO100+, which will have full effect from the 2020/21 financialyear.We are continuing to work on growth-creating initiatives, at the same time as weare ticking off the implemented cost-savings to create long-term, profitablegrowth and shareholder value for Clas Ohlson also in the future – all accordingto plan.Lotta Lyrå, President and CEO of Clas Ohlson ABPress and analyst conferenceThe report will be presented today at 9:00 a.m. in Clas Ohlson’s store atSveavägen 52 in Stockholm.
